    "selftext": "Sydney Dangar Island Boxing Day Boating Adventure\n\nThe aim of this thread is to get advice from experienced boaters around the Sydney Hawkesbury Area as well as seeing if anyone is interested in coming in on this adventure as well. \n\nMy very good friend bought himself a Cobalt boat that sunk, this is a really nice boat. He basically had no experience with boats and pretty much had to build this boat from scratch as basically everything needed to be replaced. It took him many many years and near 80k dollars and in the last few months, he finally did it. His boat is beautiful, its dead set awesome. \n\nHe has been out in this boat a few times and bought all the latest electronics and on Thursday night last week, we went out near Mooney Mooney bridge. It was about 9:15 and we decided it would be awesome to see if we can park the boat and sneak a beer at Mooney Mooney Hotel before it closed. We went under the bridge and turned left and very shortly after, ran aground. We were only going about 15kph and it was mud. Obviously, he was really worried, I think he lifted the trim and we checked the tide readings and it was almost exactly low tide. For the first time, the stupid advice I always give was the right advice. Lets see if we can wait and the problem will fix itself. So we decided to fish while we waited and finally after about 3-4 hours, the tide came in and all was good again. We floated out and aimed for the middle and put the anchor down and went to sleep.\n\nWhen this all happened in all honesty, I felt pretty useless as I am terrible when it comes to understand boats and haven't got a mechanical bone in my body. In saying that, I've always found the best way forward is to ask people who are much more knowledgeable than myself for advice regarding almost everything. So my idea to help is to do some research that he might find useful. He hates taking money from me (I have to hide it in his car otherwise he refuses it) so I thought this would be a great way to help. I'm looking for boating advice, good locations, ideas and feedback on the idea in this thread, any tidbits, any ideas, recommendations. If anyone could be kind enough to offer any help at all, it would be most appreciated. \n\nLast night, I read this cool blog about Danger Island at the following URL and the idea is to go on an adventure to Dangar Island by taking the boat out with my family (wife and 3 boys (14/11/4 and his wife) on Boxing day. I was hoping that this subreddit might have someone who could direct me to the best place to ask these questions or if I'm lucky, answer them here. The other part is that maybe someone else out there has there own boat and are looking for something to do and might want to meet us there and join the adventure. We are 40+ year old Aussie blokes who love a beer and our family and I think it would be awesome if we found a fellow boater/family who probably doesn't take out their boat enough and needs a reason to do so. Anyone would be welcome as long as you are easy going and friendly. \n\nhttps://www.sydneycompletion.com/2019/01/island-life-dangar-island-sydney-by.html\n\n1. Can we just park our boat on a public jetty on Danger Island?\n2. I assume that the two places that sell food will be closed, is this correct?\n3. Would we be allowed to take a wheelbarrow for the kids as we plan to do the 1.3km walk around and bring it back?\n4. Is there places along the Hawkesbury where you can do a sail by beer. I.e Park your boat and walk across, have a beer and set off?\n5. Is there someone on Dangar Island who wants to come or has advice for us?\n\nThanks for your help.",

    "title": "How Indonesia Sees the Philippines and Impact of the New Capital on the Philippines",
    "selftext": "# INTRODUCTION\n\nThis post will be another in a series of posts about the Philippines and Indonesia.  The first post was [How Indonesia and the Philippines](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/rp8qex/how_indonesia_and_the_philippines_define_and/)[ Define and Organize Ethnicity.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/rp8qex/how_indonesia_and_the_philippines_define_and/) This post is more geopolitical and economic-focused.\n\nThe purpose of this post is to examine how the Indonesian elite, political and economic, see the Philippines, and the impact of Indonesia's new capital on the Philippines.  Here is a map with the location of the new capital, and a post explaining why Indonesia is moving its capital, [Indonesia’s New Capital: New Nusantarian Era?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntlScholars/comments/d9h457/indonesias_new_capital_new_nusantarian_era/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u4o02ppmcra81.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=651be73320b081d5b605e442e9cc646a73b8e362\n\nThere are four main points of this post are:\n\n1. The Indonesian state sees Filipinos as kindred spirits, largely because Indonesia and the Philippines are large suppliers of overseas migrant labor. In addition, it views Filipinos through Indonesia's ethnic-cultural framework.\n2. Based on the total number of civil servants assigned to the new capital, the final population of the new capital will be much larger than the projection circulating in the media. This means the impact will be much larger than anticipated for Indonesia and the Philippines.\n3. The Philippines is militarily significant for Indonesia because it was the main invasion route used by the Japanese to invade the Dutch East Indies during the Second World War.  Security presence in the  Celebes-Sulu area will be increased sharply once the capital has been moved.\n4. The Philippines is a major export and investment destination for Indonesian companies.   The hope is the new capital will spur the creation of a north-south economic corridor that stretches from Beijing/Seoul to East Java/Central Java. The Philippines will benefit not just from closer ties with Indonesia, but also increased economic and trade flowing from North Asia through this corridor.\n\nSince the fall of Suharto in 1998, there has been an intensification of Indonesian activity in the Indonesian provinces adjacent to the Philippines. As explained in [Indonesia’s New Capital: New Nusantarian Era?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IntlScholars/comments/d9h457/indonesias_new_capital_new_nusantarian_era/) the new capital should be seen as an extension of the process of human settlement that began over 100 years ago. Secondly, there has been marked increased Indonesian engagement with the Philippines, both by the government and the private sector in the last 15 years.  Indonesian investors and brands like Anthoni Salim, JCo Donuts, Alfamart, Mayora Group (Kopiko, Beng Beng) have been in the Philippines market for the last 5-15 years.  There has also increased cooperation between the two countries in increasingly pressing issues like anti-terrorism, border security, and migrant workers. Indonesia's importance to the Philippines will only increase with the new capital.\n\n# OUTLINE\n\n1. **HOW THE INDONESIAN STATE SEES FILIPINOS**\n2. **PROJECTIONS FOR INDONESIA'S NEW CAPITAL**\n3. **PHILIPPINES MILITARY SIGNIFICANCE FOR INDONESIA**\n   1. **IMPROVED SECURITY IN THE SULU SEA REGION**\n4. **PHILIPPINES ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE TO INDONESIA**\n   1. **MAJOR EXPORT AND INVESTMENT DESTINATION**\n   2. **NORTH-SOUTH ECONOMIC CORRIDOR**\n   3. **MALACCA STRAIT VS JAVA RIVALRY: TIPPING THE BALANCE**\n   4. **INCREASED FLIGHT CONNECTIONS AND TOURISM**\n   5. **INCREASED** **ECONOMIC TIES**\n5. **CONCLUSION**\n\n# HOW THE INDONESIAN STATE SEES FILIPINOS\n\nIndonesia's relations with the Philippines have been good since they were established between the two countries in 1949.\n\nFirstly, the Indonesian state sees Filipino as kindred spirits not such on shared heritage, but because they are large suppliers of migrant laborers to many of the same countries.  About 60% of migrant workers in Taiwan are either Indonesian or Filipino **\\[1\\]** and 98% of the domestic servants in Hong Kong and Singapore come from Indonesia or the Philippines.**\\[2\\]**  There are roughly a Million Indonesians **\\[3\\]** and 4 Million Filipino in the Gulf. **\\[4\\]** Indonesian and Filipino diplomats in these countries meet regularly to coordinate efforts regarding migrant workers.**\\[5\\]**\n\nSecondly, the Indonesian state views Filipino through  Indonesia's ethnic-cultural framework.  It sees Filipino as \"cousins\" of the Minahasa, the dominant ethnic group in North Sulawesi, the province adjacent to the Philippines. The way Indonesia appoints ambassadors to the Philippines is similar to how they appoint military/police commanders in Indonesia. Non-Muslims usually get assigned to non-Muslim areas. There have been 17 Indonesian Ambassadors to the Philippines since 1953. six of them were Christian, and of those six, three were Minahasa.**\\[6\\]** As the relations with the North Sulawesi and the Javanese-controlled central government, relations between Indonesia and the Philippines have been largely smooth.\n\n**The Minahasa**\n\nAre the largest ethnic group in North Sulawesi with a population of 1.2 Million. Here are some relevant points about the Minahasa:\n\n* The Minahasa are largely Austronesian like Filipinos, while much of the rest of Indonesia is mixed Austroasiatics-Austronesian or Austronesian-Melanesian.\n* People in North Sulawesi and the neighboring province  Gorontalo speak Philippinic languages.\n* Predominantly Christian with most being Dutch Reformed  Church with a minority being Catholic. And like the contemporary  Philippines, there is a big Evangelical movement in North Sulawesi. **\\[7\\]**\n* The region was first colonized by the Spanish in the 1500s, then the Portuguese until the 1660s, and thereafter the Dutch until Indonesian independence.\n* It is a very Westernized region of Indonesia, it has been largely Christianized since the early 19th century.\n* Under the Dutch, many Minahasa served in the colonial military (KNIL).  The Minahasa was considered loyal to the colonial enterprise, to the extent North Sulawesi was called the 12th province of the Netherlands.**\\[8\\]**\n* Many people in North Sulawesi have European and Chinese ancestry. About 8% of the Minahasa population lives in the Netherlands.  In addition, its the area of Indonesia where the ethnic Chinese are best integrated\n* People from North Sulawesi are disproportionately represented in Indonesia's entertainment industries\n* Since 1952, in the Philippines, there has been a Consulate in Manado, the capital of North Sulawesi. Indonesia has a consulate in Davao City. Da La Salle Brothers also have a university in the province.\n\nSome compare the Philippines and East Timor, because of Catholicism and the cultural similarities between their colonizers, the Spanish and the Portuguese. First, Filipinos are largely Austronesian, while the East Timorese are mixed Austronesian-Melanesian.  Secondly, unlike in North Sulawesi and the Philippines, there ethnic Chinese and East Timorese are largely segregated, and there are underlying tensions between the two communities  **\\[9\\]**\n\n# PROJECTIONS FOR INDONESIA'S NEW CAPITAL\n\nThe project is set to be enshrined in law this year (2022).  According to the draft law, by the first half of 2024, it will officially be Indonesia's capital **\\[10\\]**\n\nIt is estimated to cost $32 Billion.   One million civil servants are slated to move to the new capital.**\\[11\\]**\n\nIn my opinion, the eventual impact of the move will be much larger than most people will fathom, due to the Indonesian government downplaying the potential size of the capital.  Estimates of the new capital's population range from 2.75 to 4.5 Million. **\\[12\\]** In my view, it is going to be a lot larger than even 4.5 Million.**\\[13\\]** Looking at countries like Canada **\\[14\\]** and Australia, where their capital largeLY functions as the political and administrative capital, public servants make up 35% of the workforce, **\\[15\\]** or 12% of the population. Roughly one million civil servants working for the central government in Jakarta will move. **\\[16\\]** This doesn't factor in the municipal level employees, security forces, and staff for Indonesia's State-Owned Enterprises. While Jakarta has a population of 11 Million, many of the civil servants and their families live in the suburbs in West Java.  A more realistic population estimate for the new capital would be about 7-9 Million, this will eventually make it the second-largest city in Indonesia after Jakarta. Another reason why the capital will be larger than the commonly stated predictions is the Indonesian government plans to build an 11,000 MW hydropower complex in the adjacent province of North Kalimantan,  While some of it will be used for a green industrial zone, I suspect much of it will be used for the new capital. **\\[17\\]**  11,000 MW is a lot of power,  Luzon's total electrical capacity is about 12000 MW supplying a population of 64 Million. **\\[18\\]**\n\n**Why is the Indonesian government lowballing the new capital's population estimates?**  First, I suspect they don't want to alarm people, particularly in Jakarta. It will shift a significant amount of economic activity out of Jakarta and its surrounding suburbs.  Secondly, a larger population estimate will have people questioning their project cost estimates. It is going to end up costing a lot more than US$32 Billion. Thirdly, Indonesian planners are aware Indonesians don't want to hear another megacity being created. Lastly, a larger population estimate will only worsen the speculative land frenzy in the areas designated for the new capital.\n\n# PHILIPPINES MILITARY SIGNIFICANCE FOR INDONESIA\n\nThe Indonesian state sees the Philippines as one of the two invasion routes used by invaders from North Asia. The other is the South China Sea.  During the Japanese Invasion of the Dutch East Indies during the Second World War, the main invasion route was through the Philippines, with the main objective to seize the oil fields in Kalimantan.\n\nSince 2006, Indonesia has shifted military assets northward to Natuna **\\[19\\]** and the tri-border area (Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines). **\\[20\\]** Shifting the capital to Borneo will add a defensive layer that invaders will have to contend with before proceeding to Java.  There has been increased defense cooperation between the two countries, ranging from Indonesia selling Philippines defense assets like 2 Strategic Sealift Vessels and joint patrols in the Sulu Sea.  The Indonesian government was worried about Duterte's pro-China stance because it had taken for granted the strength of the US-Philippines alliance. This along with China's incursion in Natuna in June 2016, most likely resulted in Indonesia resurrecting the first bilateral fighter to fighter training exercises between Indonesia and the US since 1997 (Cope West) in November 2016 in North Sulawesi.**\\[21\\]**\n\n**IMPROVED SECURITY IN THE SULU SEA REGION**\n\nWith the new capital, one will see more military units and assets allocated to Borneo.  At present, there is 20,000 military personnel in Indonesian Borneo (Kalimantan). The few naval and airforce bases are small, there are only two major naval bases and one large air force base.\n\nWith the movement of leadership and command elements, this posture will change significantly.    The Armed Forces General Headquarters will move, along with its supporting staff and units, from intelligence groups and military police to special forces and press officers.   The Army will create a new Capital Security Regional Command (KODAM PIK). The new army headquarters and KODAM PIK will require around 15,000 personnel, including an infantry and a cavalry brigade as well as special forces units.  **\\[22\\]**\n\nThe navy will also move its headquarters and supporting units. Current proposals call for a new ‘armada-level’ force, a new division-level marine unit, and a third primary naval base in Kalimantan. The area also needs new port facilities and bases to host and maintain major platforms as well as a new naval airfield. The navy’s transport command and hydrographic service could be relocated there as well.\n\nThe air force will move its headquarters and supporting units and create major bases and facilities. Radar and missile defense units along with a special forces battalion and two aviation squadrons could be established near the new capital. Major platforms will be deployed in the area,  **\\[23\\]**\n\nThe significantly increased military presence and patrols on the Indonesian side of the border, increase security and reduce the flow of militants and arms traveling between the two countries.\n\n# NORTH-SOUTH ECONOMIC CORRIDOR\n\n***MAJOR EXPORT AND INVESTMENT DESTINATION***\n\nIndonesia is the Philippines' 10th largest export market and 4th largest source of imports after China, Japan, and South Korea. In 2019 Indonesia's exports to the Philippines were $7.5 Billion, while the Philippines' exports to Indonesia were US$898 Million. **\\[24\\]** The top three Indonesian exports to the Philippines are vehicles, coal, and packaged food which make up 35%, 25%, and 12% of Indonesian exports. About 57% of the automotive vehicles (cars and motorcycles) imported into the Philippines come from Indonesia.**\\[25\\]**  Because of proximity, Indonesia supplies about 75% of the coal used in the Philippines. In the last decade, Indonesian products and brands have successfully penetrated the Philippines. The most notable are Mayora (Kopiko, Beng Beng), JCo Donuts, and Alfamart.\n\nThe Indonesian businessman, John Riady, once said, \"Indonesia is probably the most invisible country in the world\", and Indonesian businessmen like their country operate discreetly.  Many people think Indonesian brands are local brands, even some Indonesians think some Indonesian brands are non-Indonesian brands.  For example, a couple of days ago, there was this post  [It’s my bday and my father gave me this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/rys4jf/its_my_bday_and_my_father_gave_me_this/). This was one of the comments.\n\n>Happy Birthday gurllll.  \n>  \n>Also, diba brand ng local chocolate ung Beng Beng? Kalevel sya ng Choco Mucho kemerut if im not mistaken.\n\nBeng Beng is an Indonesian brand and has been produced by Mayora Group since the 1980s.\n\nWhen talking about Indonesian investors in the Philippines, the two names that stand out are Monde Nissin Group and Anthoni Salim.\n\nMonde Nissin launched the largest IPO in the Philippines' history last year. **\\[26\\]** It is controlled by a Chinese Indonesian family,  **\\[27\\]** who owns the Indonesian biscuit company Khong Guan Biscuit Factory Indonesia (KGBI). Khong Guan is originally a Singaporean company founded in 1941. KGBI set up a factory in Indonesia in 1972. The relationship between Khong Guan Singapore and Khong Guan Indonesia is more an association, whereby Khong Guan Indonesia uses the Khong Guan brand and certain recipes. In 1979, Hidayat Darmono, the founder, set up **Monde Nissin in the Philippines.**  The Filipino front person for Monde Nissin is Betty Ang, the Filipino wife of one of Hidayat Barmono's sons, Hoediono Kweefanus. **\\[28\\]**\n\nAnthoni Salim is Indonesia's 5th richest individual and owns Indofood, the company that owns Indomie, the world's largest instant noodle brand. About 15 years ago, through First Pacific Group in Hong Kong, he made large investments in the Philippines, particularly in infrastructure and telecommunications. First Pacific controls the MVP Group and their Filipino frontman is  Manuel V. Pangilinan.  Through MVP Group, Salim controls PDLT, Smart, Maynilad Water Services and Manila North Tollways. They also indirectly control some of the Philippines' largest media outlets like  Philippine Star, Philippine Daily Inquirer, and TV5. Salim's ownership of Smart was used by Duterte to bring in the Chinese state-controlled investment in cellular services.**\\[29\\]**\n\n***NORTH-SOUTH ECONOMIC CORRIDOR***\n\nSince the current President Joko Widodo took over, there has been a concerted effort to strengthen Indonesia's border areas, not just in defense, but also infrastructure and economic connectivity with bordering countries.**\\[30\\]** However, the Philippines is of particular importance, because it's part of the economic corridor connecting North Asia to Eastern Indonesia. In the 15th century and earlier traders would travel southward from China to Spice Islands to buy cloves; however, as a result of the Spanish restricting southbound trade, since the 16th century, this economic corridor has been largely dormant as trade shifted to South China Seas.**\\[31\\]**  Before Spanish colonialism, the dominant outside cultural influence was from Southern trade routes, whether Islam or Hindu-Buddhism.\n\nThe Indonesian government wouldn't be trying to promote this economic corridor, and by extension moving the capital to Borneo, if there wasn't underlying economic reasoning. Much of Indonesia's exports of coal, palm oil, and processed metals -- come from Eastern Indonesia. And is also critical for China, Almost, 70% of China's coal imports come from Indonesia and the bulk of its processed nickel is used for stainless steel and EV batteries.  Even China's shipments of Australian coal and iron ore pass through this region. **\\[32\\]**  Since 2014, Indonesia has placed a ban on the export of raw nickel ore and requires mining companies to build smelters.  Before the ban, Indonesia was the world's largest exporter of nickel ore with 30% of the market.  In 2022, they will ban the export of all raw metal ores.**\\[33\\]** Here is a table showing the number of smelters for various metals.**\\[34\\]**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6jp4voivcra81.jpg?width=560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a163328ab94acf84c91de2779620c895a9eb96a5\n\nAt present, the smelters are concentrated in two industrial parks adjacent to the Philippines.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ov7tzw3pgra81.jpg?width=778&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7fa7d636d527a154f3f38565a23ec42899e11115\n\n**Tembaga - Copper, Nikel - Nickel, Bauskit - Bauxite, Besi - Iron,  Mangan - Magnesium, Timbal - Lead, Seng - Zinc.** There are a couple of other metals not included in the chart like Tin and Cobalt, which Indonesia also has smelters.  Smelting is a sector where China has undercut the competition in the last 40 years. For example, North America (the US and Canada) has in total 4 Nickel Smelters (3 in Canada and one in the US.**\\[35\\]**\n\nWhile the nickel export ban is often associated with an investment in EV batteries facilities in Indonesia, \\[**36\\]** the original intention was to get more value-added exports instead of just exporting raw nickel ore. This year, its expected Indonesia will displace China as the world's largest exporter of nickel pig iron **\\[37\\]**, and next year it will most likely be the world's top exporter of stainless steel.**\\[38\\]**\n\n**NOTE:** The Philippines is trying to follow in Indonesia's footsteps, but it still has a long way to go.  Recently, Duterte has [lifted the ](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1419780/duterte-lifts-9-year-ban-on-new-mining-deals)[9-year ban on new mining deals](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1419780/duterte-lifts-9-year-ban-on-new-mining-deals) and [open-pit mining.](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/philippines-lifts-four-year-old-ban-open-pit-mining-2021-12-28/)  In 2017, Duterte was eyeing a b[an on nickel ore, but it didn't materialize.](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/philippines-lifts-four-year-old-ban-open-pit-mining-2021-12-28/)  Mining in the Philippines is a sensitive topic, most likely because most of the mines are in relatively densely populated areas, Whereas in Indonesia, they are mostly located in much more sparsely populated outer islands (outside Java), Mining is an underrated industry when it comes to industrialization. China, South Korea, and Taiwan all had large mining sectors during the initial stages of their development. For South Korea from 1960-the 1980s, mining contributed about 4-8% of its GDP.  At one point 50% in the 1960s, Tungsten made up almost 50% of South Korea's goods exports.\n\n***MALACCA STRAIT VS JAVA RIVALRY: TIPPING THE BALANCE***\n\nThe Malacca Strait civilizations, whether in Sumatra or the Malay Peninsula, and those on Java have vacillated between cooperation, rivalry, and sometimes war for over a millennium.  The rivalry was one between geography and wealth (Malacca Strait) vs productive capacity and population (Java).\n\n* 683-1025 Srivijaya Empire. Lasted until 1288, but went into decline after the 1025 Chola Invasion. Chola Empire was a Southern Indian polity.\n* 1288-1400 Singhasari-Majapahit Empire (Java)\n* 1400-1528 Malacca Sultanate (Malacca Strait)\n* 1511-1642 Portuguese Malacca vs various Javanese Kingdoms (At Parity)\n* 1643-1825 Dutch East Indies (Java)\n* 1825-1930 British Malaya vs Dutch East Indies (At Parity)\n* 1930-Now British Malaya / Malaysia-Singapore (Malacca Strait) **\\[39\\]**\n\n**Note:**  In the 1960s Singapore was the richest area in Asia outside Metropolitan Tokyo and Hong Kong, what Lee Kuan Yew is made it [more equal](https://newnaratif.com/justifying-colonial-rule-in-post-colonial-singapore/).  Malacca strait civilization by geography is fabulously wealthy.  Here is a Guardian story about  Indonesian treasure hunters possibly finding the 7-13th century capital of [Sriwijaya Empire often referred to as the Island of Gold.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/22/have-sumatran-fishing-crews-found-the-fabled-island-of-gold) **\\[40\\]** Some of the antique dealers in Palembang, the city located near the supposed capital, have collections of antiques that surpass what is found in major museums in the Philippines.  Secondly, Singapore is a classic Southeast Asian entity, a state with a small geographical area much like Sriwijaya, Majapahit and Tondo was. Until the 19th century, outside Java, controlling a lot of infertile tropical land in Maritime Southeast Asia wasn't viable.\n\nThe Konfrontasi between Indonesia vs Malaysia-Singapore could be seen in this light.   Coupled with the long-standing rivalry and contemporary issues there is an underlying tension between the Javanese-dominated Indonesia and Malay-centered Malaysia.  Issues range from Malaysian mistreatment of Indonesian workers (mostly Javanese) and Malaysia's harboring / support of separatists (GAM - Free Aceh Movement)  and radicals such as Abu Bakar Bashir.  For Malaysia, its haze from plantations in Indonesia and the culture wars with Indonesia. **\\[41\\]**\n\nIndonesia's moving the capital to Borneo is part of a long-standing goal to develop areas outside Java and Sumatra.**\\[42\\]**  Secondly, with Jakarta no longer the capital, it will give cities in Central and East Java, the homeland of Indonesia's dominant ethnic group, the Javanese, a level playing field with Jakarta.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/45vynebzcra81.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc079d9d254f9b54633e5579c92ecdb020bd624\n\n**NOTE:** The Baduy and Banten are often considered sub-group of Sundanese. While the Tengger and Osing are subgroups of the Javanese.\n\nEven before the Spanish arrived, Manila has been the dominant city in the Philippines; however, in the case of Indonesia, Jakarta's preeminence only began in the 1930s.  For example, in1930, the two main port cities in Central and East Java, Semarang and Surabaya had a respective population of 218,000 and 342,000 vs 435,000 for Batavia (Jakarta). In 2020, it was 1.6 Million, 2.9 Million vs 11 Million. \\[**43\\]** The rapid rise of Jakarta has to do with the collapse of the sugar industry in the 1930s and government centralization.  Since 2014, with the election of the current President, there has been a concerted effort to spread economic development across Java from West to East.  Here is a list of completed and planned projects that further this objective.\n\n* Completion of Trans-Java Toll Road in 2019.**\\[44\\]**\n* Completion of two Industrial Estates in Central Java (Kendal - 2016, Batang - 2020).\n* 2000 MW Power Plant in Batang in 2020.\n* Completion of new Yogyakarta International Airport in 2019.\n* US$ 1.1 Billion Expansion of Tanjung Emas port in Semarang. **\\[45\\]**\n* Two High-Speed Railway Lines across Java, a southern route funded by China and a northern route funded by Japan. **\\[46\\]**\n* Broken ground on the world's largest copper smelter in Gresik, East Java. **\\[47\\]**\n\nWhile efforts by current President Joko Widodo have been noticeable, the plans were made during the administration of his predecessor, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.\n\nOne of the main impetus behind developing East and Central Java is scaling down of the transmigration program, during the 1990s they were sending 120,000 Javanese and Balinese families every year, now it's 1000-1500 per year.  **\\[48\\]**\n\nWith the new capital along with smelters in Eastern Indonesia, the Indonesian government hopes to create an economic corridor in Southeast Asia that stretches from Philippines-New Capital-Makassar-East/Central Java that will shift economic activity from the Malacca Strait. The Indonesian control of nickel mines in the former Spice Islands is similar to Majapahit's control of these islands during the spice trade.  The last time this North-South corridor was active in the 16th century, the Philippines consisted of scattered tribes / small city-states with a total estimated population of 500,000 versus 110 Million today. **\\[49\\]**\n\n**INCREASED FLIGHT CONNECTIONS AND TOURISM**\n\nThe new capital will serve as a flight hub for Central and Eastern Indonesia. At present, if you live in cities in Eastern Indonesia like Makassar, Sulawesi, or Jayapura, Papua, if you want to fly to Manila it would mean flying to Bali or Jakarta before flying to Manila.  It will cut the flying time from Manila to Eastern Indonesia by 2-3 hours.  For example, it will open up new and shorter routes for Filipinos wanting to travel to Indonesia not living in Manila. At present, if you are living in Makassar if you want to fly to the Philippines it would mean flying to Jakarta before flying to Manila.\n\nSecondly, the new capital will not just impact travel between the two countries, but also increase traffic flows from East Asia. Flights going into Eastern Indonesia fly through Jakarta or Bali first. The only direct flights into Eastern Indonesia from China or Japan are charter.  Because the Philippines is on the flight path between East Asian cities like Seoul, Shanghai, and Taipei and the new capital, some of the flights could stopover in Manila or Cebu.  If the airports in Manila and Cebu were greatly improved they could serve as hubs for flights from East Asia into Eastern Indonesia and Australia.\n\nIn 2019, the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) suggested the two countries work together to offer joint tour packages.**\\[50\\]** However, with the new capital, such proposals become more realistic given the increased flight connectivity between Southern Philippines and Eastern Indonesia with the new capital serving as a hub.\n\n**INCREASED** **ECONOMIC TIES**\n\nThe capital move will amplify existing trends, and push companies and individuals that are sitting on the fence with regards to investing or marketing their products in the other country.  Broadly speaking, there will be increased economic ties between the two countries after the move, since the capitals will be significantly closer\n\nMoving the capital to the area involved in the processing of nickel will accelerate the development of nickel-related products like stainless steel and EV batteries. It wouldn't be a stretch to argue within a decade nearly all the EV vehicles, 4 and 2 wheels, sold in the Philippines would be imported from Indonesia. This dominance will be further entrenched by the fact Hyundai is setting up its first factory in Southeast Asia in Indonesia to export most of its production to the rest of Southeast Asia and Australia.**\\[51\\]** LG Chemicals and Hyundai began construction of Southeast Asia's first EV battery plant this month in Indonesia. **\\[52\\]**\n\nSecondly, the new capital will create a new economic center and logistics hub for Indonesia that will reduce logistic costs.  It will serve as a springboard for Indonesian companies wanting to market their products in East Malaysia and the Philippines, and for Filipino companies wishing to do so in Indonesia. Filipino's will most likely see more Indonesian consumer goods at supermarkets and Alfamart.\n\nThirdly, the new capital will boast the Mindanao and Cebu economy, which will help the Philippines ' efforts to decentralize its economy from Metro Manila.**\\[53\\]**  The Philippines education sector could benefit from increased demand from Indonesia; however, this depends on marketing efforts by both educational institutes and the government.\n\n# CONCLUSION\n\nIndonesia's current ties with the Philippines are comprehensive, and it covers a wide range of areas from investment, trade, border security,  anti-terrorism, and migrant issues.   A lot of issues have a direct impact on the Philippines and the lives of ordinary Filipinos but are rarely talked about in the Philippines' press.\n\n# [Footnotes Philippines-Indonesia](https://www.reddit.com/user/annadpk/comments/s0aey3/footnotes_philippinesindonesia/)",

    "selftext": "Hopefully, this is the right sub for this. I have always wanted to see a Naturopath to get a test for food sensitivities & check for deficiencies but have no idea how the process actually works. I have $500 available with extended health benefits. Last week I had a 1st consultation, which was 1 hour long and consisted of me answering a bunch of questions for $180. He now wants me to go for 2 tests which will cost $300+ and $500+ each. My health care provider has said that those would not be covered. I feel like I'm being scammed or perhaps this service is aimed at people with a ton of disposable income.\n\nDoes anyone have any guidance as to how this process should actually work? I imagined it would have been 1) Fill up questionnaire. 2) Brief meeting with the doctor to get tests done 3) Go through results 4) Pay $X 5) Claim benefits from provider.  ",

    "title": "Cobalt release FAQ",
    "selftext": "**[COBALT RELEASE NOW PUSHED TO FEBRUARY 2 2016](https://mojang.com/2015/10/cobalt-delayed-until-february-2016/)**  \n  \n-----------  \n  \nWe're getting close to release date little by little, so I've decided to make this FAQ for easy question-answering. If you have any other question please ask it and I'll add it to the OP.  \nI might change some stuff if I get the dev's definitive word on it.  \n  \n----------\n  \n**What do I get if I purchased the alpha?**  \n>You will get a steam key that you can redeem to play the release version of Cobalt.  \n  \n**That means there won't be a non-steam launcher anymore?**  \n>There won't. (But you will still have the old one?)  \n  \n**What will the new update - the steam release include?**  \n>It will feature the arcade section, story mode, and online multiplayer.  \nSadly due to the engine change the game will (for now) be kind of split in two: from steam you'll still be able to launch the Daisy (old editor) version where you'll be able to use the map editor, a function (for now) that is not available on the Bitsquid (new engine) version.\n  \n**What about Steam maps workshop?**  \n>Steam maps workshop integration is planned for the future. There's not many details on this except it's something everyone wants, but seems like it'll be impossible for launch to support it.  \n  \n**What about the console (xBox 360/xBox One) versions? What will they feature?**  \n>The same as the new-engine steam version: Online multiplayer (there won't be cross-platform play), story mode and the arcade (Singleplayer challenges, deathmatch, teamstrike, capture the plug and waves survival).  \nSelect community-made map packs might be offered as DLC for consoles in the future.  \n  \n**So there's no cross-platform play?**  \n>As far as I've been told, no.  \n  \n**What's the reason behind no editor and no user maps in console?**  \n>In the console version using the editor with a gamepad would probably be too tricky given all the stuff you can do in it, and clearly you can't install maps as you would on a computer.  \n  \n**What about the Linux and Mac versions?**  \n>On release, the Mac version will be limited to running in the old engine (Daisy), so there won't be online multiplayer. Of course, that won't be (hopefully) the final release for Mac, as the dev team will continue to try and port the Bitsquid version to Mac. All the other new features, though (reworked mechanics, modes, adventure, maps, tiles, local multiplayer, etc) are going to be in the Mac version on release though.  \nThe Linux version is sadly on hold for an undefined period of time.  \nIf you so desire, you can ask Oxeye for a refund, but be mindful that the price of the game will be increased to around 20€ after it's released.  \n  \n**How much will the game cost when it's released? Will it be free?**  \n>It won't be free, it's never been. It will cost around 20€ (19,95€ or so), so I recommend you go to the [Official Website](http://playcobalt.com/) and get it now for half the final price! (and you can play already!) (if you haven't yet!)  \n  \n**Will the game still feature local multiplayer?**  \n>Yes it will.  \n  \n**Will we be able to mix local multiplayer with online multiplayer?**  \n>Yes, we will. You will be able to have various players on the same computer, playing with online players at the same time.  \n  \n**How will online multiplayer work?**  \n>(All of the following is what the developers have told me and might not be definitive) Online multiplayer will consist of a list of user-created lobbies in which one user is the host and the rest can join his game. The host will be able to configure the game in a menu just as if it were local multiplayer.  \nThere will be two different kinds of lobbies: \"casual\" and \"competitive\". On casual lobbies you'll be able to join ongoing games, unlike in competitive lobbies. There will also be private lobbies.  \nNot sure about spectators yet, as they'd probably take a player slot.  \n  \n**Will the game have a global ranking system?**  \n>No, not yet.  \n  \n**What about ping?**  \n>Slow-motion has been tweaked a bit for multiplayer so it balances ping out (unless the ping is just WAY too high - up to 120 or so should still be \"acceptable\", IIRC) but the players still feel the game as normal.  \n  \n**On Steam, will I log in with my Mojang account, or my Steam account will be enough?**  \n>~~As far as I know, Cobalt will stop using Mojang accounts. You'll play with your Steam account.~~ Not fully decided yet.  \n  \n**Will there be an xBox one BETA before release?**  \n>No, there won't.  \n  \n**Will there be any other alpha release before the February release (For PCs)?**  \n>No, there won't.  \n  \n**Will the game go into Steam Early Access?**  \n>No it won't.  \n    \n**What (cool) new features will the game have, compared to v124i Alpha?**  \n>Tons of new tiles, online play, story mode, tweaked mechanics (rolling), (slightly) readjusted bullet time, (slightly) rebalanced Team Strike, some new weapons, some Oxeye maps revamped and a lot of community-made maps preinstalled with the game! (you'll find them in the arcade section!)  \n  \n**What is this about tweaked rolling you say?**  \n>Rolling has changed a lot since v124i. You are no longer 100% (or almost, if you don't count cold/heat/gamma/piercing damage) invulnerable while rolling, since you'll probably die instantly if they hit you in the feet now. In the other hand, if you hit a bullet with the top of your head, the bullet will be sent back exactly towards the enemy, way faster than it was shot at you.  \nRolling needed a nerf since, until now, spamming roll was a too easy and efficient strategy. I feel these changes add a lot of depth to the gameplay and increase the (already pretty much infinite) skill level ceiling.  \n  \n**What about the community-made maps on the xbox and xbox one versions?**  \n>The maps mentioned two points above will be included on the console versions as well.  \n  \n-------------\n  \nAny other questions? Anything I am mistaken on? Comment away!  \n  \nFor more extra info, read: http://www.oxeyegames.com/category/this-week/",

    "selftext": "Backstory: IGN recently released a review for Cobalt ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jyJeI3DD8N8 ) and put a very bad score on the game. Personally I believe the review was poorly made.\n\nWhy do I think so?\nHe played the game terribly. In the review he said \"More often than not, the reward for boldness was a frustrating demise\". It seems as if he didn't try to adapt to the game. In a lot of the clips of him playing the game in the review he ran straight into enemies and spammed all possible buttons, when a more optimal method would be to sneak around and kill them one by one. For comparison, imagine someone trying to rampage their way through the game Theif by attacking every enemy they see straight on. It's not how you're supposed to play the game.\n\nHe also complained about the \"poor\" level design in story mode. He said that enemies and machines were placed in \"random\" or \"malicious\" locations, where death was \"unpreventable\" which I don't agree with at all. Again, I think that he just failed to adapt his playstyle to the game. You need to be aware and analyze the area before entering a room and it's extremely seldom that enemies just pop up from nowhere.\n\nAt the end of the video he said that he encountered a bug which caused him not to be able to continue with the story at all, however, I couldn't find anyone having a similar problem to his. Considering his poor performance playing and adapting to the game I suspect that this wasn't a bug and it was just him failing.\n\nMore info on what he claimed to be the bug (Story spoilers):\n[He claimed that one of the keys needed to unlock the entrance to ETAC wasn't dropped when it was supposed to drop.](/spoiler)",

It was a simple platformer, with the project name being \"Blueface\". Fast forward 9 years, when the team started to revisit the game. Rolling was added, along with its unique controls. \"Blueface\" became \"Cobalt\". The definition of a type of battery reads: Lithium ion nickel manganese cobalt oxide (LiNiMnCoO 2 or NMC) offers lower energy density, but longer lives and inherent safety. \"Cobalt - It's there to protect you!\" states one of the title screen's backsplashes. Well, after the drafting of the new game \"Oxide\" sure did their research, eh?",

    "selftext": "An update for Cobalt has just been released, the technical name is v266, but it should probably be known as:\n\nThe Mods, Custom Maps Online, Enemies & Weapons Update!\n\nHere follows the change-log/summary:\n\n**Features**\n\n* Game now supports dedicated servers!

It has been added to story and survival mode.\n* Added new weapon “Rocket Launcher”. Launches a fast rocket with a medium explosion. Upgrades: “Scope”, “Extended Magazine”. Uses “Missile” ammo. It has been added to story and survival mode.\n* Added new weapon “Thermal Launcher”. Launches a slow fat missile that explodes like a smaller “Thermal Bomb” on impact or when timer runs out. Upgrades: “Homing Device”. Uses “Missile” ammo. It has been added to story and survival mode.\n* Added new weapon “Chrono Shifter”. Shoots a projectile that when it hits something or expires, it first explodes causing everything around it to go slower and secondly teleports the responsible player to the center of the explosion while also adding speed. Upgrades: “Power Crystal”, “Scope”, “Extended Magazine”. Uses “Chrono Charges” ammo. “Chrono Hulls” are more resistant to this weapon. It has been added to story and survival mode.\n* Added new weapon “Nano Pump”. Sprays nano gas that heals everything it can find.  Upgrades: “Extra Barrel”, “Extended Magazine”. Uses “Nano Gas” ammo. Will tame beasts if you heal them similar to “Nano Dispenser” and “Nano Showers”. It has been added to story and survival mode.\n* Added new melee weapon “Tractor Hook”. Attached to a wall and pull you towards it in a grappling hook fashion. It has been added to survival.\n* Added new melee weapon “Box Builder”. Spawns up to two simultaneous floating boxes that can be used both as cover and as something to stand on. It has been added to survival.\n* Added new throwable “Radioactive Vial”. Does (100) damage as well as (300) radioactivity on impact, but also emits (5) homing radioactive projectiles similar to the ones emitted by “Rad Wasps”. They can pass through walls but will fly slower and lose power. It has been added to story and survival mode.\n* Added “Auto Aim” setting in map settings next to “Bullet Time”. Options are “Standard”, “Low” and “Off”.\n* Added new throwable “Portable Sentry”. Can be attached to a wall. Copies your primary weapon. Is not limited by amount of helpers. It has been added to story and survival mode. \n* Added scope upgrade to Spike Bow. \n\n**Game-play:**\n\n* Added more unique loot throughout story, in particular more extra lives and batteries around boss fights.\n* Grenades and throwables now have a much bouncier first bounce. They will also be targetable by your own auto-aim and bullets after the first bounce.\n* ”Missile Launcher” slightly snappier ignition time, slightly more level launching angle, and slightly less effect from the shooting players speed.\n* In “Survival” all enemies now have a more uniform color theme, making it easier to distinguish friend from foe.\n* ”Ninja” cloth and goggles are now damage indicator.\n* ”Ninjas” now becomes temporarily slowed when damaged similar to Guards.\n* ”Ninja” cloth is now a team color indicator.\n* ”Fly” wings and eyes are now team color indicator\n* ”Wasp” wings and eyes are now team color indicator\n* ”Spikebird” eyes are now team color indicator\n* ”Trunkan” eyes are now team color indicator\n* ”Skullfish” eyes are now team color indicator\n* ”Skullfish” improved on-land movement animations\n* ”Jet-bike” now falls apart to indicate damage.\n* ”Jet-bike” tail fin is no longer collision.\n* ”Jet-bike” engine lights, lights and eyes are now team color indicators.\n* ”Air-Sentry” light and engine lights are now team color indicators.\n* ”Jet-shoes” flame and trails now now team-color indicators.\n* ”Missile” flames and trails are now team-color indicators.\n* ”Shroom” eyes are not team-color indicators.\n* ”Chrono Rod” now has a powerful chrono shift effect which slows down enemies, and also gives a temporary speed boost, but about 33% less damage.\n* ”Heal”, “Restore Gamma” and “Sooth Heat/Cold” now display healing / second instead of total. Total “Effect Duration” is listed separately.\n* Fires and furnaces and other warming sources now work 500% better. They will never explode you due to overheating, but they will warm you much better.\n* ”Heat”, “Cold”, “Radioactivity” have been slightly reworked in relation to shields. Before, “Shield Belts” would nullify the effect sometimes and other times the effect would pass straight through. When it did what, was a bit unclear. Instead, Shields now have effect resistances. For example, if you get hit by a “Molotov”, with an un-upgraded Shield-Belt, 50% of the heat effect is absorbed by the shield, losing charge in the process. “Nitrogen Grenades” used to 100% penetrate shields, and have often been used for this purposes in many death-match maps. Don’t worry, a direct hit by a “Nitrogen Grenade” vs an un-upgraded shield will still inflict enough “cold” to destroy the target, but the difference becomes apparent when the shield has lots of upgrades.\n* Wall mounted turrets, alarms and sentries can now be moved around with the “Materializer Gun”.\n* Improved and smoothed camera look-ahead in speed challenges.\n* Releasing left or right while flying tilted through the air as a metalface now restores air rotation.\n* ”Force device” now hits more targets in the arc when used.\n* Marketplace items and “Unique Loot” items are now indestructible.\n* Pickups now sink in water, instead of float.\n* ”Survival” now scales difficulty for enemy spawns slightly less for number of players, while still retaining the amount of attacks and size of attacks. Was (0 to 1.75) is now (0 to 1).\n* Changed default actor class for customized rules to “Agent”.\n* All low-tech melee weapons increased damage by 75%.\n* Chrono bomb sphere of influence is more clearly marked.\n* Radioactive projectiles can now pass through walls but they will fly slower and lose power.\n* Being radioactive no longer randomly blocks key actions like shooting, reloading and picking up objects.\n* Radioactive targets are now visible on the hud offscreen through a small marker.\n* Nano dispenser gas is now faster to easier catch up with running players.\n* Nano dispenser gas and Nano pump gas now only heals yourself and friendly actors, unless it explodes as which point it will still heal anyone.\n* Camera tracking in challenges has been tweaked down a little to be less extreme with the route prediction, and it now also zooms out a bit more during high speeds.\n* Nerfed most enemy shield belts in adventure and removed a bunch of them as well.\n* Added more ammo, loot and extra lives to the first chapter in story.\n* Reduced the amount of radioactivity from radioactive environmental drops by 50%.\n\n**Bug Fixes:**\n\n* Fixed capture the plug score limit defaulting to 10, now defaults to 5.\n* Fixed jet shoes climbing issue\n* Fixed nexus report being added the player database when it was never supposed to.\n* Fixed potential double reporting of kill\n* Fixed not being able to dance to music while riding pets/vehicles.\n* Fixed settings not scrolling down in game modes without presets.\n* Fixed rare crash in survival on clients related to shopping.\n* Fixed not being able to buy a gun in good condition when already having a broken one.\n* Fixed auto aim issue with aiming at Flying Flapping enemies that took gravity too much into account.\n* Fixed loading workshop maps that shared filename with an official map.\n* Fixed Gui in map editor not sorting properly when elements too big when picking from the left menu.\n* Fixed flames and beams being hitable with melee weapons.\n* Exiting adventure through other portals after beating bosses will now still count as “completing” the node. All save games that have unlocked story nodes that are not “completed” will be given 1 free restart to use when you see fit.\n* Shop maps in story no longer save player dropped items on ground.\n* Fixed bug where “Scouter Feet” would not drop from the scouter statue in “Deathshrooms”. Added “Scouter Feet” and to resupply station 1 behind cipher door.\n* Fixed bug where some enemies would not apply certain armor related damage multipliers in the right way.\n* Fixed a number of random crashes in online.\n* Fixed bug related to push-doors that are horisontal not always being one-way in the correct way.\n* Sometimes bot actors would remain for too long when a player joins mid game with balance bots.\n* Fixed the rig not resetting properly after switching weapon away after a melee attack sometimes making your attacks be inaccurate.\n* Made unique loot and blueprint ultra legendary loot always reserved for player. That way a helper cannot snatch your epic loot from under your nose.\n* Reduced intensity of light shafts in certain ETACs to reduce the amount of white-out.\n* Fixed possible crash in survival when playing online due to exceeding MAX PACKET SIZE when trying to continue after defeat.\n* Fixed muzzle flash and sounds effects not playing when a host player shoots a weapons with just 1 ammo.\n* Fixed possible crash for when heat/gamma/health/chrono exceeds network limits\n\n**Editor:**\n\n* Double clicking a tile that belongs to a tileset now defaults to picking the tileset. CTRL+Double click to force pick the specific tile, or right click and select “Pick Tile”. This behaviour can be changed in Options -> Pick-Mode.\n* Added mod editor! F9 to access. Mod editor allows you to create a new mod resource for uploading to the steam workshop.\n* Added a ton of new collision tiles, decorative tiles and more.\n* Added 3 new actor types, Walker, Spring Bot and Protobot.\n\n**Other:**\n\n* Simplified the menu shader color distortion and raised the crispness of the entire menu.\n* Made the online menues more like the arcade menues.\n* Put arcade map descriptions in a box for better alignment!\n* Settings have been split into 3 categories -> graphics, sound and system.\n",

    "selftext": "I LOVE COBALT\n\nI love the gameplay, slo mo, and culture of the game as well as many other things.\nHowever there are some things I wish could be better. I honestly think just a pc version should have been released. The Xbox version is great but my current impression is that its very buggy and should have been delayed. The story mode is OK. I like a lot of the features but its just too hard. I'm currently at boss fight #2 and I'm having trouble just getting to the boss. If the A.I difficulty and/or the damage for most of the enemies could be reduced it would be much better.I also feel like the A.I reacts too fast and makes perfect headshots. I would also like Oxeye, or Mojang/Mircosoft host some servers. It would help to eliminate lag and other connection issues. The players could change the game mode and other options but the server is backed up by OXE or Microsoft. I also agree with others that say the game wasn't well advertised or put out there. I expected that the giant that is the Mircosoft ad team would have done more considering how big they are. Finally I think the game price should be dropped. 20$ is lot for some people and considering the faults right now its not = in my mind. Maybe 10$ is better price? Anyway this a big post but I think it puts together what other people have been saying. I really love the game and just want the best for it. Besides the above, the game is great and I want to thank Mojang and Oxeye for making this awesome game. If you guys have any other comments please reply below!\n\nTL;DR \n\n*An Xbox version should have been not produced or delayed\n*Oxeye and Mircosoft should host some servers and configure it so players can still customize the game rules, map and stuff.\n*The story needs a damage and/or a Difficulty nerf\n*The A.I in story mode is too fast and is too good at landing headshots\n*The game in my eyes should have been better advertised\n*The price should be lowered to $10 (roughly)",

That's all understandable too; I know it's not something you all wanted... But can we at least get some pre-release versions?

    "selftext": "So I can't seem to find a change/update log from v124i to v125 in the full release, but the movement is quite different in this version. Movement is far, far more sluggish, not nearly as snappy and responsive, and rolling's slower. There also seems to be increased delay between activating roll and the roll animation playing, and base movement speed feels slower, though one or both points might be incorrect. Last thing, double jumping only works some of the time now when coming out from a punch/phaser boost; particularly with phaser boosts, you'll only be able to jump once if boosting into the air sometimes.\n\n\nRelease has been pretty exciting and I don't wish to put a downer on any of that, but I'm unsure of what changes have been made, what's a necessary product of the new engine, what might be bugs, etc. And the new movement is really lackluster relative to what we've been playing the last 4 years, in my opinion. If anyone has any information (regarding these changes or their experiences), please let me know! ",

    "selftext": "Hello all, pfm2001 here.\n\nAs many of you know, Cobalt dropped Mac/Linux support in favor of the online competition. Many people were angry, but I have a possible idea.\n\nBefore the Gold version was released, Cobalt had an Alpha version available to download for free on Mac, Windows, and Linux. However, upon updating to OS X El Capitan, one is met with a messed up login screen and no feasible way to play the game, as described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cobalt/comments/4sx3wg/is_cobalt_pretty_much_a_failed_game_due_to_an/d5dzqk4) in the middle paragraph. I am not sure if the same happens to Linux users.\n\nMy suggestion is to re-release the Alpha and update it so that it works on newer Operating Systems as a form of demo, seeing as how the official demo on Steam is also Windows only, and I have tried every thinkable way to get it to work on Mac without having to use Bootcamp or a Virtual Machine (Because I would have to purchase a license for both of them, and I cannot buy anything, as I am a minor and have no money.)\n\nDo you agree? Why or why not? I personally think this would be a great filler while we wait for Cobalt's new engine to get Mac/Linux support. Besides, some people prefer to buy games based on how they liked the demo, so people can decide if they want to buy Cobalt once it gets Mac and Linux support.\n\nIf any developer of this game needs the older files, I will gladly send my own files if that will suffice.\n\n(Also, forgive me if I broke any rules on accident, this is my first new text post on Reddit.)",

    "selftext": "Basically, historic #tailings are the leftover junk from old #mining operations—what miners tossed aside because it wasn’t worth processing at the time. But now, thanks to better tech and higher metal prices, a lot of that \"junk\" actually has value.\n\n[ore tailings project](https://preview.redd.it/i9clfhjrbg6f1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8250acd13c2ce2dadaf1db00ba4c7744ab2c0f8)\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\n1.  **Re-evaluation**: First, geologists and engineers test old tailings to see what’s left in them. Older mines often missed fine particles of metals like gold, copper, or rare earths.\n\n2.  **Modern tech = better recovery**: New processing methods (like improved flotation, leaching, or even bio-mining) can extract metals that old-school methods couldn’t touch.\n\nSome key technologies that make this possible:\n\nUltrafine grinding: Tailings often contain metal locked inside tiny mineral grains. Modern milling equipment can grind particles down to microns, making it easier to liberate metals during processing.\n\nImproved flotation: New reagent chemistries and column flotation techniques help recover ultra-fine particles, especially sulfide minerals like chalcopyrite (copper) or pyrite (often gold-associated).\n\nAdvanced leaching methods: Heap leaching, pressure oxidation (POX), and bioleaching can extract metals like gold, copper, or even cobalt from tailings that weren’t suitable for cyanidation or traditional methods in the past.\n\nSensor-based ore sorting: Some sites now use X-ray or laser sorting to scan and separate tailings particles by mineral content—before processing even starts—making the whole operation more efficient.\n\nTailings regrind-flotation circuits: This combo is commonly used to recover remaining sulfide minerals from old concentrator tailings.\n\n3.  **Profit from the past**: If the metal content is decent and the costs are reasonable, companies can build small plants or retrofit old ones to reprocess the tailings. They’re basically mining the waste.\n\n4.  **Bonus: environmental cleanup**: Some sites are actually cleaner after reprocessing. It’s like recycling, but with rocks and metals.",

I’d love to hear your opinions on this controversial subject and explore the potential investment opportunities it may bring.\n\nDeep sea mining involves retrieving mineral resources from the ocean floor. With the demand for metals such as cobalt, lithium, and rare earth elements on the rise—key components in batteries, electronics, and renewable energy technologies—many companies are eyeing the vast mineral wealth buried beneath the waves.\n\nAt the heart of the deep sea mining discussion lies a debate about environmental impact versus economic necessity. Proponents believe that with responsible management and advanced technology, we can minimize environmental harm while reaping significant benefits. However, critics warn that the deep-sea environment is fragile and largely unexplored, meaning the long-term effects of mining activities are largely unknown. The potential for habitat destruction, the release of toxic materials, and the impact on species that are already threatened by climate change are all concerns that cannot be overlooked.\n\nThat all being said. Have you come across any investment opportunities—stocks or ETFs—focused on deep sea mining or the extraction of metals from the ocean? Currently, only a handful of companies and funds are involved in this sector, including those engaged in underwater exploration and resource extraction. However, it’s key to consider the associated risks. Investing in emerging technologies and industries often comes with volatility and uncertainty, especially in a landscape where regulatory scrutiny is tightening and opposition is mounting.\n\nWhere best might someone begin to invest in this market?",

Their fund acquired couple of potential projects, and one of them is a tin project. He asked me if i want to invest to advance their exploration efforts, they do have a scoping study done, and having read it through, consulting firm have recommended an exploration plan, and have labeled out the zones. It’s an open area, and about 150 hectares.\n\nNow, i have invested in the past, not much, about 10k to explore a potential gold mine, it didn’t take. I do have background in strategy and management. I do love rocks and geology. But i have no clue whatsoever about tin processing. Precious metal as i understand are more straightforward to take, yet still complex. Now i’m perplex and intrigued to figure out if it’s something i’d be interested in. \n\nI’m looking to gauge the amount of investment required to undertake an exploration effort for this project. I’ll obviously hire an expert team, a company to come and drill and explore the areas suggested by the predessecors and consultants. I’m not looking for a quote lol, but an approximate cost to hire a company to come and explore the 150 hectares of land in Asia, in a safe country with infrastructure in place and a town near it.\n\nAlso, is it safe to assume it’ll be a two part work to confirm if its feasible or not? For instance, will it be explored in part1/pre-feasibility to get inferred resources and potential technology to extract it? Followed by part2/feasibility to confirm the technology and measure the resources? Then obviously, if everything works out, be able to get financing to develop the mine and take it to industrial level? \n\nIs there a demand for tin? Will banks finance tin mining? I am not in the industry so any help would be appreciated. It’s just that we all hear about gold, copper, cobalt etc, they are all “sexy” metals, while coal and iron are not so sought after metals, from my understanding. Is tin at all appealing to big investors? \n\nSorry for the wall of text. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nTl:dr\nLong story short, i’m looking for companies that provide mining exploration services in an asian continent. And i’m also looking to understand how much it would cost to hire the company to conduct an exploration and advanced exploration based on jorc? This is for Tin metal, also curious if it’s even in demand.\n\nI’m based in US btw, so it’d be more of a handsoff project for me.",

    "selftext": " There is a method to electrify our automobiles, trucks, and buses without imposing the same hazardous burdens on specific populations that our existing energy system does. In truth, there is a clear place to begin: Reform the law in the United States that has allowed the mining industry to pollute freely for over a century and a half.   We understand that in order to preserve our planet from climate change and protect ourselves from volatile energy prices, we must rapidly build out electric vehicles, charging infrastructure, solar panels, and wind turbines to power our towns into a clean energy future.   \nThis transformation is known to be dependent on essential minerals such as lithium and cobalt, which are used in batteries that power electric vehicles and store sustainable energy.  With essential mineral demand predicted to increase by up to 500% by 2050 to power devices (such as laptops and cellphones) and clean energy technologies, we must ensure that demand is met in a secure and sustainable manner. We have an opportunity to achieve what the fossil fuel sector never did by committing from the beginning to preserve the communities and areas most touched by clean energy development. Mining produces critical minerals, which can often be reused once obtained. Mining operations, like the oil and gas sector, have damaged valuable environmental and spiritual sites while releasing toxic waste into our air, water, and land.    \n Updating our laws and regulations is part of the sustainable solutions needed to meet the demands for critical minerals and ensure that our clean energy future isn’t built on a foundation of dirty mining.  While we must endeavor to meet crucial mineral demand by reducing, reusing, and recycling current materials, we recognize that some mining will be required to get us to that clean energy future. That is why we are striving to modernize our mining rules and regulations in order to fulfill future demands while avoiding some of the most egregious impacts to people and the environment.

According to Earth Justice https://earthjustice.org/blog/2022-may/critical-minerals-mining-reform  For 150 years, the Mining Law of 1872 has governed mining operations on over 350 million acres of public lands—territory owned by the public but stewarded by the government for the benefit of the people.  The Mining Law of 1872, enacted during the gold rush era when the American government intended to \"settle\" the West and forcibly remove Indigenous people from their land, has remained practically unchanged since then.   Mining firms enjoy an even better deal under the law than other extractive industries like oil and gas, at the expense of US taxpayers, Indigenous communities, and environmental protections.   \n The existing law emphasizes mining over all other land uses, including iconic natural landscapes and Indigenous holy places, and permits mining companies to carry out dirty extraction operations without significant environmental safeguards or engagement with tribal populations. When these firms have depleted all available resources, current law fails to hold them accountable for cleaning up rampant pollution, leaving a legacy of toxic waste that harms communities for centuries.  Mining is harmful to the humans and the environment.  \n It could lead to massive loss of lives and properties.Blockchain projects like Nature’s Vault have advocated for abolishment of gold mining and Cardano has advocated for the reduction of carbon footprint. It is impossible to look past the issues raised by these projects. Mining is a serious issue and should not be taken lightly.",

    "selftext": " \n\n# Rio’s hush-hush copper find in WA shaping up as a big ’un – and 1c Sipa is right on the boundary\n\n##### Satellites don’t miss much nowadays when it comes to monitoring fresh land disturbance, particularly where cloaking vegetation is sparse.\n\n##### \n\n📷Satellites don’t miss much nowadays when it comes to monitoring fresh land disturbance, particularly where cloaking vegetation is sparse.\n\nIt is something that Rio Tinto is finding out, no doubt much to its annoyance, at its yet-to-be formally confirmed copper discovery (reported here first on April 6) in the northern reaches of Western Australia’s remote Paterson province.\n\nWhile Rio is yet to confirm the discovery in what is Lawrence of Arabia-type country, latest satellite imagery suggests it is indeed on to something that just might shape up as special, rewarding Rio for its efforts, and giving a bunch of exploration juniors looking to make it big in the Paterson a leg up.\n\nEvery time it punches in another drill hole, we’ll all know about it thanks to the satellite imagery being captured over the discovery every five or six days. It’s a satellite driven continuous disclosure regime outside of Rio’s control, and the ASX for that matter.\n\nLatest public domain satellite imagery shows that amongst the sand dunes of the Paterson and some 120km north-north-west of Newcrest’s once Tier 1 Telfer gold-copper deposit, Rio has drilled at least 10 holes at 200m spacings with selected 100m infill holes. More to the point is that the satellite imagery recently picked up nearby site preparation work for what is said to be a 40-man camp.\n\nBuilding a camp in sand dunes is most unusual. Rio obviously wants to be up nice and close to what it has found and not spend a couple of hours each day trundling over the dunes to get there. \n\nBack on planet earth, the scuttlebutt is that after mapping a subtle IP granite-related anomaly, drilling by Rio hit primary copper at a depth of 40m and then visible primary mineralisation down to depths of 180m in two holes 200m apart just before what was the 2017 drilling program came to an end.\n\nIts early days for sure. But intersections of 140m of visible mineralisation in spaced holes is something to get excited about, even for a company the size of Rio. And it did get excited, launching itself in to a massive pegging campaign to lock up the regional upside in December last year.\n\nIt pegged all the way north-west to 80 Mile Beach between Port Hedland and Broome on the coast, taking its land holding in the Paterson to a massive 9,000sqkm. Now that it has “locked’’ up the discovery, the great hope for the rest of the industry is that Rio formally confirms the find and gives a feel for its potential, even though it doesn’t have to under ASX disclosure rules because of its monster market cap.\n\nBut it’s probably way too early for that. The industry will nevertheless be watching – or should that snooping – as the forward drilling program at the discovery evolves, and activity levels in and around the camp set amongst the sand dunes picks up, albeit it from space.\n\n#### Other players:\n\nThe bottom line of the Rio discovery is that that the north Paterson region has emerged as a hot spot for copper exploration in Australia. And despite Rio’s pegging frenzy, there are a number of other of established and newbie players active in the hunt for the next big one.\n\nThe established players are Sipa (SRI), trading at all of 1c, and Antipa, trading at 1.3c. The newbies are Fortescue (FMG), which needs no introduction, and another junior, the neatly named Red Metal (RDM), trading at 11.5c.\n\n#### SIPA:\n\nThe Rio camp-in-the-dunes looks to be about 8km from Sipa’s south-west tenement boundary.\n\nMore than that though is that Sipa’s 2018 field season in the north Paterson is about to get underway (funnily enough Rio recently signed a potentially big-spending farm-in agreement on Sipa’s Akelikongo nickel-cobalt project in northern Uganda).\n\nThe program will drill test Sipa’s Obelisk discovery (anomalous copper over 100m in previous holes) and the Andromeda target (nickel, copper and PGE’s from a RC hole drilled by previous explorers). In addition, Sipa has worked up a bunch of new targets (Asseli, Aranea and Jordanus) which will be further refined with geophysics ahead of a reconnaissance drilling program to start soon.\n\n#### ANTIPA:\n\nAntipa has the biggest ground position in the broader Paterson behind Rio, some which is the subject of potentially big spending farm-in agreements with Rio on its Citadel project area, due east of the Rio discovery and home to the Calibre deposit (1.3m ozs of gold and 70,000t of copper and open in most directions)  and the Magnum deposit (339,000 ozs of gold and 58,000t of copper and open in most directions).\n\nBut the real action for Antipa in coming months is on its wholly owned ground covering deposits and prospects within 40kms north of Telfer – Minyari Dome (a near-term development opportunity from the Minyari-WACA resource base which comes with upside), Tim’s Dome (a high-grade gold opportunity 12kms from Telfer), and Chicken Ranch (a near surface high-grade gold prospect 15kms from Telfer).\n\nFor the record, Telfer has produced 14Moz of gold and 340,000t of copper since its discovery in 1972.\n\nAntipa’s field season starts this month and could involve up to 50,000m of drilling. Strong newsflow is likely. It is finishing off a $7.5m capital raising (placement and rights issue) in support of its big push this year in the Paterson.\n\n#### RED METAL:\n\nRed Metal has been travelling nicely on the strength of its base metals projects in Queensland. But it recently joined the fray in the north Paterson, picking up a tenement position immediately to the north of the Rio discovery.\n\nLike many others, Red Metal would have been aware of Rio’s pegging frenzy and was luck would have it, it was able to pick up what it now calls its Yarrie copper-cobalt project. Rio then immediately picked up the ground to the north of Yarrie.\n\nBurt Red Metal’s move had more to do with the release of government data in February which Red Metal read as pointing to the potential for the Yarrie ground to host “giant’’ sedimentary-hosted copper-cobalt deposits akin to the Mount Isa or Zambian styles, with the Paterson already having known smaller versions (Nifty and Maroochydore).\n\nRed Metal is planning some deep penetrating EM surveying to map and rank the dome shaped structures for drill testing.\n\n#### FORTESCUE:\n\nAndrew Forrest’s iron ore producer has pegged a sizeable ground position to the north of Rio’s 100% owned ground and that of Sipa. It is a big company so doesn’t need to talk about what it’s up to. But the satellite snoopers out there will keep an eye on any activity by the group which is getting serious about diversifying its mining interests now that the discount on its sub 60% iron ore has become structural and not a passing phase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.resourcesrisingstars.com.au/news-article/rio%E2%80%99s-hush-hush-copper-find-wa-shaping-big-%E2%80%99un-%E2%80%93-and-1c-sipa-right-boundary](https://www.resourcesrisingstars.com.au/news-article/rio%E2%80%99s-hush-hush-copper-find-wa-shaping-big-%E2%80%99un-%E2%80%93-and-1c-sipa-right-boundary)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://thewest.com.au/business/speculation-builds-over-rio-tintos-east-pilbara-copper-find-as-first-images-emerge-ng-b881017433z](https://thewest.com.au/business/speculation-builds-over-rio-tintos-east-pilbara-copper-find-as-first-images-emerge-ng-b881017433z)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://smallcaps.com.au/rio-tinto-copper-find-rumours-spread-backs-share-price-buy-back/](https://smallcaps.com.au/rio-tinto-copper-find-rumours-spread-backs-share-price-buy-back/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://thewest.com.au/business/mining/rio-tintos-tiddler-deal-fuels-talk-of-copper-find-ng-b88871005z](https://thewest.com.au/business/mining/rio-tintos-tiddler-deal-fuels-talk-of-copper-find-ng-b88871005z)",

    "title": "King Copper’s Ghost: The Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Natural Resource Curse",
    "selftext": " The Democratic Republic of the Congo is currently in the midst of an Ebola outbreak that has cost the lives of 191 individuals. Although a vaccine for Ebola has finally been developed, constant warfare makes it all but impossible to distribute treatment. The recent history of the DRC has been marked by brutal series of wars that has cost of over 4 million lives, and the DRC has a per capita income under $800. This dismal picture is shocking given that Congo is blessed by rich deposits of copper, diamonds, cobalt and other national resources. Today’s podcast episode is going to focus on why Congo has been unable to translate this natural resource wealth into prosperity for ordinary people. In part one, I will discuss the paternalistic policies of the Belgian Congo and how the left the country unprepared for independence. In part two, I will discuss the corruption of the Mobutu regime, and how the mining industry collapsed under his rule. Finally, in part three I will discuss the current transformation of Congo’s mining industry, and the pivotal role the Congo will play in the rise of electric cars.\n\nMany of my readers are likely familiar with the ruthless rule of King Leopold in the Congo Free State that cost the lives as many as 8 million Africans. If not, I strongly recommend reading [King Leopold’s Ghost](https://www.amazon.com/King-Leopolds-Ghost-Heroism-Colonial/dp/0618001905), by Adam Hochschild. The Belgian government took over the administration of 1908, and very much took “the White Man’s Burden” seriously. By 1960, the Belgian Congo had eradicated the tsetse fly from populated areas, and the highest literacy rate in sub-Saharan Africa. However, there was a very real dark side to Belgian rule in the Congo. Exploitation and coercion where everywhere. The government forced Congolese to work one sixth of the year on public works projects, and private corporations had the power to force Africans to work on plantations.\n\nThe achievements of the Belgian Congo were financed by the rich reserves of copper in the Katanga province of Congo, and UMHK, an Ango-Belgian conglomerate, sent the bulk of its profits to Europe. The Belgian colonial government deliberately privileged certain ethnic minorities to create ethnic conflict they could manipulate. Above all, the Belgian government saw Africans as little more than big children and presumed they would rule indefinitely. The education made primary education readily available, but only a handful of university graduates. At independence there wasn’t a single African military officer in the police and security forces, and no Africans in the colonial administration with real authority. The Belgians left the Congolese as unprepared as possible for independence.\n\nAfter independence, the United States supported the regime of Mobutu Sese Seko, a brutal and corrupt dictator because he was strongly anti-Communist.  At first, the mines ran much as before, with mining output reaching all time highs of around 500,000 tons in the late 1970s. However, the government assumed the period of high commodity prices would last forever, and so did not maintain large financial buffers, or invest in maintenance. Instead, the Congolese elite consumed the wealth with avarice. The fall of the USSR proved a disaster for Mobutu mean the end of vital American support. The power lines that connected the mines in the interior to hydro-electric power plants on the coast were cut by militias, and rioters chased the ethnic minority that held the majority of management jobs in the mines. Mining output decreased from close 500,000 tons of copper to 35,000 in 1993. In 1994, millions of Rwandans refugees fled into the Congo in the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide, sparking the brutal Congo Wars and putting the final nail in the coffin in the Congolese mining industry.\n\nThe DRC’s mining industry has steadily rebuilt itself after the end of the Second Congolese war in 2003. Cobalt has emerged as a key component in the manufacture of lithium ion batteries used in electrical cars. Soaring demand has led to the price of cobalt more than doubling over the last two years to $50,000. While some electric car companies, such as Tesla, are attempting to minimize the use of cobalt, demand is likely to soar in coming years. Whether the Congo benefits from this boom is a more complicated question. About one fifth of the cobalt is comes from artisanal mines, where wages are low and workers as young as seven.  Dan Gertler, an Israeli businessman who financed the father of the current dictator’s rise to power, controls the allocation of new mining permits. The Inga-Kolwezi transmission lines that connect hydro-power dams at the mouth of the Congo to Katanga only generate power for the mines, but not the surviving villages. While export revenues have soared, it is unclear if Congo has the institutions to transform this into prosperity for ordinary people.\n\nThe DRC’s natural resource wealth has not benefited ordinary people because those in charge have little incentive to do so. The Belgians had no incentive to make to Congolese capable of self rule. Mobutu had little incentive to allow the countries resource wealth to benefit those not connected to his regime. The current regime does not seem able to use Congo’s resource wealth in a way that benefits the country. The news stories coming out of Congo are almost universally tragic, whether it is civil war or epidemic. Changing the narrative about the Congo will require reforming the countries institutions. Lets hope this time the Congo manages to do so.\n\n# Selected Sources\n\n[Copper Giants Lessons from State-Owned Mining Companies in the DRC and Zambia](https://resourcegovernance.org/sites/default/files/documents/nrgi_nmc_english.pdf)\n\n[MORE CONTINUITY THAN CHANGE?

    "title": "King Copper’s Ghost: The Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Natural Resource Curse",
    "selftext": " The Democratic Republic of the Congo is currently in the midst of an Ebola outbreak that has cost the lives of 191 individuals. Although a vaccine for Ebola has finally been developed, constant warfare makes it all but impossible to distribute treatment. The recent history of the DRC has been marked by brutal series of wars that has cost of over 4 million lives, and the DRC has a per capita income under $800. This dismal picture is shocking given that Congo is blessed by rich deposits of copper, diamonds, cobalt and other national resources. Today’s podcast episode is going to focus on why Congo has been unable to translate this natural resource wealth into prosperity for ordinary people. In part one, I will discuss the paternalistic policies of the Belgian Congo and how the left the country unprepared for independence. In part two, I will discuss the corruption of the Mobutu regime, and how the mining industry collapsed under his rule. Finally, in part three I will discuss the current transformation of Congo’s mining industry, and the pivotal role the Congo will play in the rise of electric cars.\n\nMany of my readers are likely familiar with the ruthless rule of King Leopold in the Congo Free State that cost the lives as many as 8 million Africans. If not, I strongly recommend reading [King Leopold’s Ghost](https://www.amazon.com/King-Leopolds-Ghost-Heroism-Colonial/dp/0618001905), by Adam Hochschild. The Belgian government took over the administration of 1908, and very much took “the White Man’s Burden” seriously. By 1960, the Belgian Congo had eradicated the tsetse fly from populated areas, and the highest literacy rate in sub-Saharan Africa. However, there was a very real dark side to Belgian rule in the Congo. Exploitation and coercion where everywhere. The government forced Congolese to work one sixth of the year on public works projects, and private corporations had the power to force Africans to work on plantations.\n\nThe achievements of the Belgian Congo were financed by the rich reserves of copper in the Katanga province of Congo, and UMHK, an Ango-Belgian conglomerate, sent the bulk of its profits to Europe. The Belgian colonial government deliberately privileged certain ethnic minorities to create ethnic conflict they could manipulate. Above all, the Belgian government saw Africans as little more than big children and presumed they would rule indefinitely. The education made primary education readily available, but only a handful of university graduates. At independence there wasn’t a single African military officer in the police and security forces, and no Africans in the colonial administration with real authority. The Belgians left the Congolese as unprepared as possible for independence.\n\nAfter independence, the United States supported the regime of Mobutu Sese Seko, a brutal and corrupt dictator because he was strongly anti-Communist.  At first, the mines ran much as before, with mining output reaching all time highs of around 500,000 tons in the late 1970s. However, the government assumed the period of high commodity prices would last forever, and so did not maintain large financial buffers, or invest in maintenance. Instead, the Congolese elite consumed the wealth with avarice. The fall of the USSR proved a disaster for Mobutu mean the end of vital American support. The power lines that connected the mines in the interior to hydro-electric power plants on the coast were cut by militias, and rioters chased the ethnic minority that held the majority of management jobs in the mines. Mining output decreased from close 500,000 tons of copper to 35,000 in 1993. In 1994, millions of Rwandans refugees fled into the Congo in the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide, sparking the brutal Congo Wars and putting the final nail in the coffin in the Congolese mining industry.\n\nThe DRC’s mining industry has steadily rebuilt itself after the end of the Second Congolese war in 2003. Cobalt has emerged as a key component in the manufacture of lithium ion batteries used in electrical cars. Soaring demand has led to the price of cobalt more than doubling over the last two years to $50,000. While some electric car companies, such as Tesla, are attempting to minimize the use of cobalt, demand is likely to soar in coming years. Whether the Congo benefits from this boom is a more complicated question. About one fifth of the cobalt is comes from artisanal mines, where wages are low and workers as young as seven.  Dan Gertler, an Israeli businessman who financed the father of the current dictator’s rise to power, controls the allocation of new mining permits. The Inga-Kolwezi transmission lines that connect hydro-power dams at the mouth of the Congo to Katanga only generate power for the mines, but not the surviving villages. While export revenues have soared, it is unclear if Congo has the institutions to transform this into prosperity for ordinary people.\n\nThe DRC’s natural resource wealth has not benefited ordinary people because those in charge have little incentive to do so. The Belgians had no incentive to make to Congolese capable of self rule. Mobutu had little incentive to allow the countries resource wealth to benefit those not connected to his regime. The current regime does not seem able to use Congo’s resource wealth in a way that benefits the country. The news stories coming out of Congo are almost universally tragic, whether it is civil war or epidemic. Changing the narrative about the Congo will require reforming the countries institutions. Lets hope this time the Congo manages to do so.\n\n# Selected Sources\n\n[Copper Giants Lessons from State-Owned Mining Companies in the DRC and Zambia](https://resourcegovernance.org/sites/default/files/documents/nrgi_nmc_english.pdf)\n\n[MORE CONTINUITY THAN CHANGE?

    "selftext": "I've seen alot of activists here either out-right reject the environmental impacts of mining the metals needed for Solar and Wind, or the environmental impacts of mining the rare metals needed for the batteries and even the disposal of them.\n\nWe're not just fighting for America, Australia or France. Don't shut your eyes to the consequences in Indonesia, Africa and India that see the environmental impacts of our expansion of Solar  and Wind. Dont plug your ears  at the practical rape of the land and environment in the Third World. We're fighting for the world, and as such we need to find the best methods to produce electricity using as little Coal and Oil while also reducing the Environmental Impacts of those methods of electricity production, and that means we MUST consider alternatives where available.\n\nRenewable Energy is an admirable, noble and worthwhile goal to actively pursue, but we must be mindful of the impacts of the mining and disposal of materials used in their production. The mining of Cobalt, Tungsten and Lithium are highly destructive in places like Africa where the mines will clear cut areas and leave regions poisoned with extremely toxic chemicals. Photovoltaic cells are a prime example, with a  fair chunk winding up unceremoniously dumped in third and second world countries that often cant or dont process the toxic elements of them, instead letting them seep into local rivers and underground water systems\n\nRemember, we're not just fighting for our neighborhood, or just America and Europe. We're fighting for the world and that includes Africa and Indonesia. Keep this in mind as we seek methods and systems to eradicate Coal and Oil from use entirely and permanently.",

Solar & wind are < 3% of global energy use in 2020.  20% of energy will be renewable by 2040 under ideal conditions.  Battery and wind rare earth demands will cause shortages before 2030.

China poured more cement in 2 years than the US in 100 years 2017 - 2018.  10 yrs clearing the skies of smog in China raised global north temps 0.1 C.  Renewables will not delay 1.5 C or reduce emission anywhere near 50% in 10 years. Food, water, supply chain shortages and pandemics will severely affect renewables.

    "title": "Dominion Power is planning to dump untreated Coal Ash wastewater in the James River, this cannot happen!",
    "selftext": "This text is from the Upper James Riverkeeper FB page.\n\nDetails: VDEQ Issues Two Draft VPDES Permits for Coal Ash Pond Dumping Current Status: Dominion applied to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VDEQ) for authorization to “dewater” its coal ash storage ponds at two power plants: Bremo, on the James River in Bremo Bluff, and Possum Point, on Quantico Creek and the Potomac River in Dumfries. On October 30, VDEQ issued draft permits that authorize the dumping of toxic water from coal ash ponds into the James River and Quantico Creek, and has announced a public hearing for each facility. These permits would authorize Dominion to drain millions of gallons of contaminated water from its coal ash ponds at both sites directly into the James River and Quantico Creek, and via Quantico Creek into the Potomac River, without sufficiently protecting human health and the environment. Hearings: Virginia DEQ will hold a public hearing for each site, at which it will accept oral and written comments from the public. Bremo Power Station: a public hearing will be held on Tuesday, December 1, 2015, at 7:00 PM, with an informational briefing at 6:00 PM. Location: Central Elementary School 3340 Central Plains Road Palmyra, VA 22963\n\nThe agency will accept written comments on both proposed permits until December 14. Submittals must include the names, mailing addresses and telephone numbers of the commenter/requester and of all persons represented by the commenter/requester. Comments for Bremo may be emailed to Beverley Carver at beverley.carver@deq.virginia.gov, or mailed to: Virginia Department of Environmental Quality c/o Beverley Carver 4411 Early Road P.O. Box 3000 Harrisonburg, VA 22801\n\nBackground: These draft permits authorize the release of tens of millions of gallons of polluted water into the James River and Quantico Creek. This water is currently contained in ponds full of coal ash. There is considerable uncertainty about how VDEQ arrived at many of the requirements in the draft permits. The draft permits, as written, do not comply with the Clean Water Act—the law under which they are issued. The Clean Water Act requires the application of the best achievable technologies to treat wastewater before it may be discharged to our rivers and streams. Metals in the wastewater at both facilities include aluminum, antimony, arsenic, barium, boron, chromium, cobalt, iron, magnesium, molybdenum, manganese, nickel, selenium, and zinc.\n\nYet the draft permits require little to no treatment of this contaminated water. The permits allow Dominion to discharge harmful pollutants at high levels, instead of requiring the application of technologies that currently exist to treat coal ash wastewater to far lower levels of contaminants. The limits are also far higher than those imposed on “dewatering” in other states – for example, the Possum Point draft permit sets the monthly average limit for arsenic at 300 µg/L, 30 times higher than the limit of 10 µg/L proposed for Duke Progress Energy’s L.V. Sutton coal ash facility in North Carolina. VDEQ should require Dominion to meet the same limits that are being used at other coal ash facilities.\n\nBremo: The wastewater at Bremo has also been documented to contain high levels of toxic metals, including arsenic at levels as high as 604 µg/L – more than four times greater than Virginia’s chronic toxicity standard to protect aquatic life. The draft Bremo Permit authorizes the discharge of water with concentrations of arsenic up to 740 µg/L. These limits are not stringent enough to protect aquatic life and human health. For instance, the Bremo draft permit authorizes the discharge of hexavalent chromium at levels up to 35 µg/L, 3.18 times Virginia’s chronic toxicity standard for aquatic life, and authorizes discharge of selenium at 43 µg/L, 8.6 times Virginia’s chronic toxicity standard for aquatic life. VDEQ assumed that the discharged pollution would completely mix with the water in the James River and be sufficiently diluted during low flow conditions – but had to use a 10-mile stretch of the river to draw this conclusion. Common sense says that it will take time for pollutants discharged at high concentrations to dilute down to safe levels – meanwhile, the pollutants will be in the water at concentrations harmful to human health and aquatic life. The James River is a high-quality water resource with excellent smallmouth bass sportfishing, catfish for the table, rare and sensitive species of mussels, and abundant opportunities for recreation in and on the water. The James River watershed is home to one-third of all Virginians, who live in its 39 counties and 19 cities and towns. The river serves as a drinking water source for millions via water intakes for public water systems. Discharging high levels of harmful industrial pollution into the James River is plainly irresponsible. Conclusion Letting Dominion dump coal ash wastewater with high levels of pollutants into our treasured waterways fits a pattern of VDEQ giving Dominion an easy out, instead of ensuring the protection of water quality for human health and the environment. “Dewatering,” in this case, is the first step toward closing the coal ash ponds in place at Possum Point and Bremo, leaving the coal ash inside, and allowing these ponds to continue to pollute groundwater, the James River and Quantico Creek. The high limits and failure to apply achievable technology in these draft permits would also establish a bad precedent for “dewatering” of coal ash ponds around the Commonwealth. DEQ can and should do better.\n",

    "selftext": "A few years ago a friend told me about electric blue mine runoff near a small mountain town. I had to see for myself, so a year and a half ago I went. My god was it blue. I’ve seen many, many abandoned mines but I’ve never seen something like this. I’ve been itching to find out why ever since. Blue mine water is my Roman Empire. \n\nHere are a few things that I’ve learned: the mine was built somewhere around 1930 and stopped all activity before the end of the 1950s. \n\nIt was the only nickel mine in the entire state. The mine had moderate success extracting nickel ore. The secondary mineral was cobalt, which was present throughout the mine. Tested ore ranged from .5 to 6.2% cobalt. It’s unclear whether they were actively extracting cobalt or if they simply noted that it was present throughout.\n\nThey did not mine copper, nor did the ore contain significant amounts of copper. The one exception is a passage contained ore ranging from .1%-31% copper. Still, the other passages of the mine had only marginal amounts of copper.\n\nAs you can see on the last pic, the blue water is visible on google maps. There was a LOT of mining in the surrounding area. Primarily for gold. I’ve scrubbed through and haven’t found any more instances of blue water. \n\nI visited in the winter so the area was covered in snow, but the water appears to be flowing from a lower mine entrance. I can’t find any traces of blue water flowing from any tailings.\n\nI can’t find any record of milling taking place at that site. \n\nI email the EPA pictures. They called me almost immediately and asked the location. I gave them coordinates. However, this is all on private land and I’m doubtful whether the landowner allowed them on the property. \n\nCuriosity over this has been driving me crazy. Can anyone lend any insight?   ",

    "title": "Questions on Speculative Geology",
    "selftext": "Hello all,  \nSo TL;DR is that I have a worldbuilding project that I have based around the star 18 Scorpii (18 Sco). It’s considered a near-solar twin, but I came across [this 2015 paper from *Astronomy & Astrophysics*](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2015/07/aa26269-15/aa26269-15.html), which details some interesting geochemical differences that I wanted to pick yalls brains about. \n\nSpecifically, the star shows slightly elevated abundances (\\~5% greater than the Sol system) in elements like Fe, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Ni, and V. Notably there is also a 3x higher abundance of Lithium, Cobalt and several neutron-capture elements (e.g., Sr, Y, Zr, La, Ce, Nd) present in the star itself. \n\nAssuming a terrestrial planet formed from the same protoplanetary material as 18 Sco I was wondering about a couple of things, mostly centering on if there would be any noticeable changes in the prevalence of any unique minerals that are more rare on Earth. I know this is all speculation but I am just curious what yall would think. \n\n* Assuming the paper is accurate, what kinds of minerals and rock types would you expect to see more of in such a planet’s crust generally speaking. \n* Would these abundances significantly affect the prevalence of things like olivine, feldspar, pyroxene, or spinels? How would these abundances affect the coloring of a moon like Earths, drastically or no?\n* Since my lore details that this planet was sterile until around 2000 years ago, im curious about the abundance of minerals that are Biotic in nature, for example I have a story on this planet centered around a stone mason, and I'm curious if something like marble (which I know forms form limestone) would be drastically more rare or only slightly so.\n\nThanks in advance! I’m aiming for scientific plausibility in my fictional setting, and I really appreciate any input on what might geochemically “pop” in this kind of system. Also I hope this doesn't violate any rules and I will take this down if it does. ",

    "selftext": "Me and the boys, 5 older geology students/researchers near 30 that are graduating, want to go do a boys trip to Vietnam to buy gems and check out the geology. We are 2 mineralogists and 3 exploration geologists that have been working/employed on research/gold exploration/prospecting projects for the last few years and have been in school between 6-8 years, the thing is we don't know much about the actual industry there beyond what they offer.   \n\n\nI just got back from a trip to Colombia where I picked up Emeralds for myself and half a dozen others in the Department. In Colombia the mining industry is controlled by the cartel. It would be suicidal to visit a mine down there as an outsider, especially expecting to get to extract anything yourself, it's even dangerous to tell the wrong people in certain areas you're a geologist. To buy the emeralds I had to use a department connection to get a few local escorts to bring me to a middleman between the mines and the emeralds stores in Bogota and I bought the emeralds off them in relative safety, though we still had a minder watching us. I also needed the escorts to act as security to help get the gems back to the hotel as they said you can be followed and robbed easily.  \n\n\nOn the other end of the scale, we have prospectors/ small artisanal gem mines we've done free work for here in rural Canada on a near drop-in basis in order to extract material ourselves in our spare time since the prospectors running them don't know shit and love to have us and even often use us to cook their books by claiming to pay us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther countries I've heard from one of our profs are often thrilled to have geologists who want to visit as similar to the prospectors/artisanal mines here, they'll use you for a bit of unpaid work/consulting as geologists from Canada are quite well trained. However to show up in countries like Colombia expecting that is a great way to get Bre-X'd in the Jungle.  \n\n\nOur min prof is the leading expert on Cobalt Blue Spinnels from Baffin Island and as such the 2 min guys with us who worked with him are very interested in those gems specifically (Vietnam also has them) though their research is mainly on emeralds, rubies and sapphires. Me and the other two exploration dudes work in Gold Exploration with various companies but then the group of us also do prospecting on the side and have about 4square kms of mineral rights to lithium and gem-bearing pegmatites/granites and have been getting amethyst (and soon beryls) extracted and cut from our own claim on the side while we develop the plot into a sellable lithium claim.   \n\n\nSuffice to say we are young but relatively experienced.   \nWe want to check out spinnels, sapphires, tourmalines, rubies, and maybe some other stuff.   \nThe Luc Yen area is of particular interest.  \n\n\nIs there much danger/criminal enterprise in the industry there?\n\nHow weary/open are they to outsiders?\n\nHow regulated is it?\n\nOn a scale from:  \n0 - Being don't go anywhere near the industry without a connection/security/guides and even then you can only meet a middleman/seller\n\nto \n\n10 - Being have at it, they'd love to use you guys and only have to pay you in gems you can extract yourself.\n\nWhat can we look to expect in Vietnam?  \nAny locals that might be able to help?  \n\n\n  \n\n\n&#x200B;",

For my Sedimentary Stratigraphy class, we are doing an experiment on Evaporites where you pick what you wanted to do as long as it was Evaporite related.\n\nIn our study we wanted to know how the evaporation of Table salt is affected by a Drierite, Calcium Sulfate & a Calcium Sulfate w/ 2% Cobalt Chloride. We left our samples under a fume hood for 2 weeks taking daily notes and we noticed the table salt with the Calc Sulf began growing hairlike features that were almost fiberous. It began covering the outside of the beaker as well! (as shown)\n\nWe were wondering why this could have happened, or at least a push in the right direction for the research?\n\nAny help is appreciated <3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ygyd9676ftm21.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ea0947e5250e8a0c8aa7dfdb651b0bf9d2bab52f",

I live in Los Angeles, California (where PZEV actually might help with the smog and air quality, but also only if literally everyone converted to PZEV). **How do I make this decision with regards to the lifecycle environmental impact?**\n\nAs a side note, these vehicles are all AWD because I have built up a bad habit of snowboarding over the last few years, but I'm starting to stop due to the environmental impact and overall less interest due to moving to Los Angeles and being farther from the mountains. I think the best choice for me would be for me to abandon snowboarding (even if I move to the Bay Area next year) and get a prius prime. I'm not yet ready to move to abandon a car altogther yet (sorry).\n\nAlternatively, I could just keep the Subaru and donate all the extra money with not getting a new car (transaction costs, depreciation) and use that to buy carbon offsets (likely between 5k to 20k over the next decade with not buying a new car)",

    "title": "Planet of the Humans:A documentary without hope",
    "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n \n\nA poorly edited documentary about the woes of the green revolution was released for free on Youtube yesterday. You might consider its makers the left of the left, a fringe hating the movement generally loved by the left. Can’t anyone who loves the planet get behind green energy? It appears not. I dislike this documentary about as much as I loved it. It highlights some of what I have been thinking for about three years now. What it did not do was offer solutions, which I will do for you and for the makers of this film. If you were to watch this piece and do nothing further you might feel that we are now completely hopeless. The tech we hoped to save us can’t. Wind turbines, solar panels even hydro all have environmental implications. The truth is, the green energy you might be thinking is going to be ubiquitous will just be a small bit player in a truly verdant future.\n\nI’m going to outline for you problems and, in my view, a few viable solutions. First let’s discuss the film itself. The film is bleak starting with an Earth day celebration narrated by a bore in Gibbs. He found diesel backup at an Earth day celebration. Guess what? Who cares. Small beans. The film then goes on to complain about car manufacturers making electric cars, using the Chevy Volt as a prop because the electricity that fuels them in Lansing Michigan is from coal. My question for the film maker is this: Does he expect everything to change all at once in every city in the world? He probably does, but that isn't possible. I think its OK to build a carrot to force the stick be built. It how things are going to happen, if they happen at all. He should be spending his time talking about what it would take for the nation to electrify vehicular travel, with low or no emissions. It still requires the electric car! Damn him for pooing on real progress that was the Volt. If there is a tragedy in the film it’s that Americans didn’t embrace the Volt in the first place!\n\nI’m going to skip to the ending for a minute. Gibbs tell us at the end of the film what we have to do. Its answer: Use less. What an over simplified, ridiculous and vague cop out of an answer. It IS true that we need to use less, but what does he mean by this? How much less? What’s most important to use less of? How should we power the planet for what we still make in an era of less? Should we just turn off the lights and cars and hospitals and businesses and food production and call it a good run for humanity but it’s time to die now? No answers or hints of answers in this film. This is a problematic ending. It decries use of typical energy sources, then does the same to green energy then offers nothing in its place. The film is not *wrong* but it brings us to place of hopelessness where all things are equally bad.\n\nThings are not equally bad. Solar and wind turbines have merit, and it is more than that of coal. Wind turbines for example pay back their manufacturing cost (in terms of greenness not money) in three years. They last for 20. It’s 17 years of useful green energy. It is however intermittent, and when it isnt provide power natural gas is its backup. Windmill farms do, as the documentary spends a lot of time pointing out, often hurt the environment they are put in by having forests cleard for them or killing apex birds. But again, this film fails to offer an answer. Gibbs could have suggested a changes to the EPA that rates environmental degradation prior to placing wind or solar on the land. It is yet again political will that we need here to provide a holistic framework to place renewables. **We should concurrently be working on truly recyclable plastics for everything, including windmills and solar panels.** We should be working more on long term storage batteries including iron flow, and testing out massive gravity storage application to balance out wind and solar. We should be working on replacements for chemicals used in turbines that are extremely environmentally unfriendly like Sulphur hexafluoride, or SF6, which has a CO2 equivalent of 117 tonnes of carbon ([That is not a misprint](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-49567197)) per windmill if emitted. Still these technologies are better than a coal plants which release about two billion tons of CO2 per year. **Remember energy isn't free and steps into the future will involve compromise.**\n\nNext, the problems of accountability shown in the film.\n\n‘Green’ energy is nuanced and we don’t have a standardized system of accounting for what is and isn’t worthwhile. What this documentary revealed was just how far corporate tentacles have reached into the organisations we think untouchable. Examples provided are the Sierra Club, Al Gore and Tesla. However these people and organisations who have put environmentalism on the dinner table menu never get a chance to defend themselves. This film is part hit piece and the director isn’t happy with anyone, including himself.\n\nWhat Gibbs seems to find most frustrating apart from humanity’s existence is biomass energy. Biomass is difficult to define because it can mean many things. The US energy administration defines biomass as energy derived from burnt wood chips, agriculture waste, food garbage or manure including sewage. This invites an important distinction under the green umbrella. There is renewable and there is low carbon. Burning wood for energy is nice by a campfire but one of the worst ways possible to power an industrialized nation. High resource use, high carbon emission, low energy density, particulate emissions, but yes renewable.\n\nMoving onto solutions Because this movie doesn’t have any. (Warning US centric)\n\nSolution 1) Electrifying everything, especially cars. I am a believer in the series hybrids such as the Volt and this is why I was so upset to see it used as a foil. You can use a lot less cobalt in a battery that is ⅙ the size of a typical Tesla. The Volt had a 50 mile battery and when depleted and gas generator kicked on to power the battery. Most people drive less that 30 miles per day, and would decrease gas use by 70–80% for most people. This is like getting a gasoline car that got 115+ miles per gallon. The Volt could have been the perfect transition vehicle into a more electrified nation. We build chargers everywhere and learn to build better batteries with less rare metals which are toxic, and mined under horrific conditions.\n\nSolution 2) Have a commission that provides both a general rating and a specific rating to a given technology and what can be done to improve it. These ratings should be simple enough for the public to understand them. For example a rating of 1 is the ideal green energy and coal is a 10 where does X technology fall? And on the site that is being proposed, does it change this number. Is this old, slow growth forest move a 3 technology to a 6? Keep the rating measure simple even if what going into the rating is complex. This would help keep things like biomass from seeming friendly when it isn’t.\n\nSolution 3) Solar, wind and hydro where it makes sense while we continue to work on underlying tech that would alleviate the need for natural gas as backup. I feel that solar and wind belongs in rural places that are too small to economically connect to larger electrical grids. So what do I think should power most other things, see solution 4.\n\nSolution 4) Nuclear. The film touches on nuclear for such a short time (about 10 seconds) that you get the feeling that the word nuclear alone is supposed to be enough to scare off any one willing to watch such a film as ‘Planet of the Humans’. What I am calling for is Gen 4 walk away safe Nuclear. Such as what Bill gates has spent a billion of his own dollars [developing.](https://www.terrapower.com/) In addition developing small modular nuclear reactors in the realm of 200–300MWe per unit. Why?\n\nNuclear is the greenest power source, even compared to wind and solar, [LINK](https://www.zdnet.com/article/nuclear-less-co2-than-solar-hydro-biomass/). It is the least deadly power source [LINK](https://www.statista.com/statistics/494425/death-rate-worldwide-by-energy-source/). It is dispatchable (non variable), meaning it doesn’t require an entire extra natural gas backup plant to exist when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing. Did you know that natural gas companies LOVE wind, are backing and promoting solar and wind energy? For every solar setup we build we are committing ourselves to 20–30 years of a wind/NG combination. It is much better than a coal plant, but much worse than a nuclear plant.\n\nFurther, we don’t have to overbuild nuclear energy. To have wind and solar power the US without NG we would have to massively over build capacity (not within any economic reason) [LINK](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/radical-idea-get-high-renewable-electric-grid-build-way-more-solar-and-wind-needed). Nuclear is nearly plug and play and doesn’t require the massive infrastructure overhaul that 100% solar and wind would require.\n\nDownsides of nuclear before the commentators get to it, and no neither the pro or con list is exhaustive.\n\nCost: Nuclear is very expensive up front. There are plenty of ways to mitigate this but in the end there will always be truth to it. When energy experts consider any form of energy they use LCOE (levelized cost of energy). Nuclear is very competitive in terms of $/kwh, but it requires large upfront investment. What we need is the *ideal* large and small reactors developed with the help of multiple governments and companies. One design for a large plant and one design for a small plant. Then those governments that developed can build it out for free. Ideal designs would be walk away safe design (no meltdown possible), molten salt reactors (efficient, non pressurized reactors), using uranium waste as fuel. That’s right, these plants can eat spent nuclear waste (an over simplification read more about that and more [here](https://www.wired.com/story/next-gen-nuclear/)). Side note: Forget thorium (which has a huge fanboy club), it’s not needed and ultimately has similar problems to uranium. You can still make weapons from it, you can make salt reactors with uranium, and yes I want to use waste uranium — not dig up new thorium.\n\nNuclear proliferation: Simply put, the biggest contributors to global warming already have nuclear weapons. If in the future these plants made it to countries without nuclear weapons I believe they should be heavily defended but that’s a concern for the distant problem that I wish we had now.\n\nNuclear waste: The plants I’m espousing use nuclear waste to fuel themselves. Also, consider this. All nuclear waste in the USA right now could fit into one super Walmart. Bam! It is so much more manageable than detractors want you to think and comes down to the one thing I’ve kept mentioning in this article: Political willpower.\n\nOne day nuclear power won’t be the best option. We may finally develop a perfect batteries for short, medium and long term energy storage solutions. Fusion might finally work. Maybe clean coal becomes more than a figment of republicans’ imagination (ha!). But for now it is by far the best option we have. We can begin building out our best iterations and keep developing the ideal solution which could be ready for massive implementation in 10 years such as a Terrapower module. It has already been 10 years since the Great recession, what the hell have we been waiting for, a pandemic?\n\nFor us to tackle global warming, in time or at all, it is going to take brutal pragmatism. That is why I believe this film, Planet of the Humans, is helpful. While it is unnecessarily hopeless it does convey that not all things are what we think they are. Green isn’t always green, it’s complicated. Right now while trillions of dollars are being spent to support the world during a pandemic is the perfect time to pivot to a long overdue clean future. It might be the only time until another catastrophic event arrives, approximately 10 years from now, making it 40 years later than we should have acted in the first place to save the Earth.",

The potential consequences of these lower-probability, but higher-impact, events would be devastating for human societies.\n\nThe bulk of climate research has tended to underplay these risks, and exhibited a preference for conservative projections and scholarly reticence, although increasing numbers of scientists have spoken out in recent years on the dangers of such an approach. \n\nClimate policymaking and the public narrative are significantly informed by the important work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). However, IPCC reports also tend toward reticence and caution, erring on the side of “least drama”, and downplaying the more extreme and more damaging outcomes. Whilst this has been understandable historically, given the pressure exerted upon the IPCC by political and vested interests, it is now becoming dangerously misleading with the acceleration of climate impacts globally. What were lower-probability, higher-impact events are now becoming more likely. \n\nThis is a particular concern with potential climatic tipping points — passing critical thresholds which result in step changes in the climate system — such as the polar ice sheets (and hence sea levels), and permafrost and other carbon stores, where the impacts of global warming are non-linear and difficult to model with current scientific knowledge. \n\nHowever the extreme risks to humanity which the tipping points represent, justify strong precautionary management. Under-reporting on these issues is irresponsible,  contributing to the failure of imagination that is occurring today in our understanding of, and response to, climate change. \n\nIf climate policymaking is to be soundly based, a reframing of scientific research within an existential risk-management framework is now urgently required. This must be taken up not just in the work of the IPCC, but also in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations if we are to address the real climate challenge. \n\n**Current processes will not deliver either the speed or the scale of change required.**\n\nThe Understatement of Existential Climate Risk - most populations accept \"the most flagrant violations of reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them and were never sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening\" | Spratt and

    "selftext": "!!! BATTERIES: The Next Internet Boom !!!\n\nOne of the early inhabitants of the collapse ecosystem was the gold bug shill. You may think I'm smart enough to invest in metals, you'd be mistaken. I invest in things like water and food.\nYou guys know I get my drip from extractive mining.\n\nOur hi-tech green energy world owes its existence to 40,000 child slave miners in the Congo. I'm sure when they lay their heads down at night, that nothing consumes them more than the sexual justice mores of campus elites.\n\nWe are now in the next super cycle of battery metals\n (core finance 7:00)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Roj6QK7tpgA\n\n- Investor very up for lithium, cobalt, nickel, zinc and silver. \n- 2017 = 3.5 m e-cars, 2025 = 75 m e-cars\n- 2017 VW Golf = 30 Kg copper, 2017 e-Golf = 70 Kg copper\n- 2017 Tesla = 8 Km copper wire\n- 2018 = China building 10 Battery Giga Factories\n- Battery issues = reloading cycles, capacity, charge speed and recycling costs\n- PR issues = green e-cars now run on labor of black child slaves\n- New Cobalt Kings = Australia + Canada\n- E-car issue = Can't run without nuclear power\n\nThere's a silver mine in Ontario, Canada called Colbalt. The Rockefellers did some filthy nasty union bashing treating Canadians little better than the child slaves of the Congo.\nIt's hard to find now. It's called Colbalt: The Hole Story. I think the missing H in Whole is purposeful. This is all I could easily find.\n\nColbalt Ontario Historic Silver Mines 2016 (mine rat 20:00)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qmvufpUDWtk\n\nAnthony Milewski: Nickel Demand to Greatly Increase as Battery Technology Advances ( minerat 20:00)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/EhC_mM-4lLE\n\n- Anthony has a wee wee over nickel.\n\nCobalt - A demand and supply analysis (Andrew Hingston 10:00)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zsjEZvt4SzQ\n\n- super excellent anal ist\n\nTesla Model 3 Needs More Lithium, Cobalt and Graphite (goldstocktrades 12:00)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/R9hTENUDYx8\n\n- I must have watched some of this.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI know 75 million e-cars by 2025 sounds like a lot, but there are a billion cars on earth. And they all only account for 10% of emissions. But their unjust extractive mineral consequences run counter to green intentions. We don't have the carbon budget to replace a billion cars on roads every 10 years.\n\nWe don't have the carbon budget to replace all the planet's solar panels and wind turbines every 30 years. \n\nEnergy demand will double in 30 years.\n\nEmissions have to hit 0% in 30 years to stay below 2 C.\n\nWater and soil will disappear before we have 100% green energy.\nhttps://lokisrevengeblog.wordpress.com/2016/01/24/no-soil-water-before-100-renwable-energy/\n\nWe add to the greed and ignorance by promoting self driving cars, which require a massive 5G build out. We are trying to pile on extra metal and mineral demand while driving into the wall on supply. It is simply impossible to overstate how badly we are dealing with this. \n\nReaders who are a stoot will have noticed I didn't even mention climate change and species mass extinction. Mass extinction means the fluctuation of all the weight each species on earth occupies. So if you have 1 tiger, the species is not extinct even though 99% of all tigers since 1914 are gone. My grandmother was born in 1914.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
