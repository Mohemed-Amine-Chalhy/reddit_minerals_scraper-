    "title": "Why doesn’t Australia manufacture Lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries?",
    "selftext": "LFP batteries are one of the most resilient and durable batteries in commercial usage. BYD has their blade shaped LFP batteries estimated to last >60 years. It lacks energy density and slow to recharge, which is less relevant if it’s used as a huge community battery. Australia does not lack space and the raw ingredients. As batteries go, it’s one of the cheapest options available. Life span doubles if it’s only charged up to 75% or quadruples if it’s capped to 50%.\n\nIron export prices are tanking. We have the minerals resources. We have 3rd of the world’s lithium. We have the phosphate. We have too much solar energy that goes to waste. We have the money. We have the connections. \n\nWe have a lot of educated and skilled people here. We can R&D and re-invent the wheel or pay money to buy the technology. Issues of manufacturing, use government money or offer tax incentives or offer a contract. Century batteries are still being made locally. We export 75% of our lithium and lots of iron to China, so we have potential leverage. \n\nWe talk about green hydrogen energy and nuclear power, but electricity is free or near free with some of the energy sellers due to midday solar surpluses. Unlike other energy sources, electricity stored in batteries is versatile and readily available. We have seen community batteries work in SA. \n\nDo we lack the political courage? or the willpower? or the imagination?",

Another 14 commodities ranked in the top five for world economic resources: bauxite, black coal, brown coal, cobalt, copper, ilmenite, lithium, magnesite, manganese ore, molybdenum, silver, tin, tungsten and vanadium (Table 5). Australia’s ranking for economic resources of molybdenum rose from sixth in the world in 2021 to fifth in 2022 as economic resources in China were revised downwards and Australian resources increased.\n\nIn 2022, Australia was the top global producer for bauxite, iron ore and rutile (all bulk commodities), as well as lithium which is important for battery storage technologies. Australia was the second largest producer of lead and zircon; the third largest producer of gold, manganese ore, rare earths and zinc; the fourth largest producer of cobalt and uranium; and the fifth largest producer of black coal, nickel and tantalum (Table 5). During 2022, Australia was a reliable and responsible top five producer of 15 minerals and metals, of which eight are listed in Australia as Critical Minerals and two are listed as Strategic Materials[^(13)](https://www.ga.gov.au/aimr2023/world-rankings#fn13).",

I'm likely to always be renting so investing a few thousand into batteries is fine as long as I can take them with be between rentals.\n\nThe price of electricity is 21c/kw at night time and 42c/kw during the day and I know how much electricity I use - I was wondering if I could buy an appropriately sized battery that I charge during off-peak rates and consume during peak rates.\n\nAt the most basic, I thought I might be able to buy several UPS boxes and put them on the most demanding things in my house - but it turns out enterprise server hardware is quite pricey.\n\nIn concept, I looked into using a battery with a suicide cord and plugging it into an outlet - where the real solution would be hiring someone to set it up on the breaker box directly so it's safe - but I don't know what the conventional approach people take for receiving power from the grid and an auxiliary source simultaneously. \n\nI was thinking I could program an RPI that has an automated switch on the breaker which can switch between power coming from the battery or coming from the grid or power from the grid and charging the battery - but that feels naive.\n\nAnyone got some experience with this sort of thing that can help out?\n\nShould I just scrap the idea as a pipe dream?\n\n**EDIT: Doing the math - tl;dr more than 10+ years to pay off, probably not worth it.**\n\nI use about 200 KWh per month or ~7 kwh per day average\n\nExcluding daily charges, with my current rate of ~40c per kwh, I pay $80 per month or $960 per year \n\nIf I were able to offset the entire amount with batteries which charge using the off-peak rate of 21c I would pay $42 per month or ~$500 per year.\n\nThis gives me a saving of $460 per year. [Assuming batteries cost something like $5k AUD](https://energetechsolar.com/7kwh-48v-150ah-lifepo4-lithium-battery-energy-storage-system), it would take 10 years to pay off.\n\nI also don't always use peak hour rates, so in reality I'd just offset the evening hours and shoulder rates - which makes it even less viable.\n\nIt's also a fire hazard.",

    "selftext": "I was in Singapore for 2 weeks over New Years. It was about March (back in Sydney) when I realised that I had misplaced my Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro earbuds. I just assumed I'd lost them somewhere on public transport or at the office and gave them up to the lost property gods.\n\nA few weeks later I read a post where someone used a \"Find My ...\" app to locate a device. I did the same and to my surprise, they were last seen at them at the Singapore Police Found and Unclaimed Property Office. Awesome! I might be in luck here.\n\nSingapore Police were a little robotic in their replies but confirmed they had my earbuds and that I'd need to arrange an international courier to ship it back to Sydney. They also said I'd need to confirm the courier's packaging requirements before arranging pickup.\n\nFedEx looks to be my best bet as DHL don't ship anything with lithium batteries. FedEx gave me instructions to book a pickup but advised that I may need to hire a broker to clear the shipment on arrival as when the shipment arrives in Australia, it has to be cleared by a broker that specialises in personal effects.\n\nThis is rapidly heading towards the \"fuck it, too hard\" basket for a 2 year old pair of $300 earbuds. Does anyone have any experience/advice they can give me about getting personal property like this back into the country without spending a fortune or dealing with unnecessary red tape?",

    "title": "PSA: My home battery calculations.",
    "selftext": "So I have read lots of threads saying that home batteries don't make sense right now. But is that still correct? I haven't seen anyone show calculations. We are looking at upgrading our solar system to well in excess of what we will use, so below are my calculations for considering a Battery.\n\nEach evening after the sun goes down until it comes us my household imports over 5kwh of electricity, this happens all year. Our current charge is just under 30c/kwh. (.30\\*5kw\\* 365) = $536/ year for after dark power. If we installed a 5.2kwh (4.9Kwh usable battery) which is charged by solar and drained flat each night, we could potentially save importing that 5kw of electricity. This would be a best case scenario, so lets assume it is too cloudy to fully charge or the battery degrades earlier than expected, and only works 70% of the time (536\\*.7) **$375/year savings with a battery.**\n\nI understand that batteries can reduce the amount of power you import during the day, but they can also fail to discharge fast enough during peak demands. There are probably other factors I have not considered.\n\nI have been quoted $5k for the supply and install of a GoodWe Lynx Home U Series (LV) LX U5.4-L (5.4kWh / 4.86kWh usable) plus an extra $750 for the hybrid inverter (in addition to the $750 classic style inverter).\n\n1. If power prices stay the same, and it works 70% of the time the battery system will just pay itself off in about 15 years ($375\\*15)  well after the warranty period for the battery ends.\n2. If power prices stay the same and it works 100% of the time it pays it's way in just under 11 years.\n3. If we see power prices rise to 40c/kwh, and the battery works 80% of the time it breaks even under 10 years.\n4. If we see power prices rise to 45c/kwh and it works .7% of the time it would be paid off in \\~10 years (45c/kwh \\* 5kwh \\* 365 = $800/year \\*.7 of the time \\* 10 years = 5750)\n5. If we see power prices rise to 45c/kwh and it works 100% of the time it would be paid off in 7 years. (*insert unreasonable math here)*\n\nOk so what if we installed and used all of a 10kwh battery every night, at an expense of \\~ 8750?\n\n1. If power prices stay the same at 30c/kwh and the 10kw battery works 70% of the time we would save 1095/year, and would take 11 years to pay off.\n2. If power prices increase to 40c/kwh and the 10kw battery works 70% of the time we would save 1168/year, and would take 8 years to pay off, substantially quicker than the smaller battery. Currently don't regularly reach 10kwh/ night.\n\nThe question is, What have I missed? If you had the cash, would you buy a small battery, large battery or invest in lithium stocks?  \n\n\nEDIT:  \nI found an online calculator for Australian conditions. It seems quite conservative, as it assumes a 5kw battery is $7500, and I cant seem to edit that. But interesting to play with: [https://solarcalculator.com.au/](https://solarcalculator.com.au/)",

    "selftext": "Check it out.\n\n**Tesla Semi:** 40 tonnes - 800 km range - 30 minute Megacharger for another 600 km.\n\n**Janus Semi: 100 tonnes!!!** \\- 600 km range - but 4 minute battery swap for another 600 km! Watch the forklift swap the battery - (but big robot dooverlackies coming soon.)\n\n[http://youtu.be/aizG265NeII](http://youtu.be/aizG265NeII) More at The Driven. [http://thedriven.io/2022/02/10/janus-unveils-first-electric-truck-for-australian-east-coast-battery-swap-route/](http://thedriven.io/2022/02/10/janus-unveils-first-electric-truck-for-australian-east-coast-battery-swap-route/)\n\nThe age old problem with big electric trucks is the bigger you make the battery to extend the range, the heavier the battery. The heavier the battery, the less cargo you can take, and the less profitability per truck and driver's salary. It's a bit like the rocket equation where you end up taking heaps of fuel with you to carry the fuel. Imagine if rockets could refuel half way up? It would change the whole industry.\n\nEG: Tesla's Semi does 800 km in one charge! Great! Tesla can get another 400 km charge in a half hour break. Great! But what's not so great? 40 tonnes per trip. But because the Janus truck isn't trying to take all it's battery in one go, the it can carry 100 tonnes. That's 2.5 times the cargo of the Tesla. Janus drives half or a third of the way and swaps the huge battery over, and then keeps on going with that 100 tonnes. One Janus truck with 2 or 3 swappable batteries suddenly replaces 2.5 whole Tesla trucks to buy and charge, and 2.5 driver's salaries.\n\nThe Janus system is just moving more with less, even if it requires 3 batteries for every one truck. It also means the battery does not have to super-charge like the expensive Tesla Mega-charger. Tesla try to charge 80% of the battery in half an hour - but Janus can take a few hours to recharge the battery for the next truck. It means less stress on the battery and electricity grid.\n\nIt means if a truck ever runs out of charge somewhere, there could be roadside assistant trucks with robot or forklift doovers that take the old battery out and swap in a new one.\n\n## Range\n\nThis also means range anxiety is no longer a thing - as both of these are well over what an Australian trucker is legally allowed to drive in one shift. They’re meant to stick to 100 km an hour and have a half hour break in 12 hours. That means a top LEGAL range of roughly 1150 km. [http://www.truckers-trip-planning-app.com/australian-standard-hos-rule](http://www.truckers-trip-planning-app.com/australian-standard-hos-rule)\n\n# Take advantage of improved battery tech\n\nThey're converting 67 trucks this year - with plans for much BIGGER Aussie road trains! Road trains can carry up to 200 tonnes!\n\nAlso \"Decoupling the battery system from the truck gives the vehicles a longer life and allows them to benefit from rapid advances in future battery technology. The electric truck’s 720 horsepower is at the top end of most diesel motors’ power output and supplies a range of 400 to 600 kilometres.\"\n\n[https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/entrepreneur-big-trucks-big-savings-big-electric-plans-20220811-p5b91o.html](https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/entrepreneur-big-trucks-big-savings-big-electric-plans-20220811-p5b91o.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What does this mean?\n\nElectricity is vastly cheaper than diesel, period. Like 1/3rd the cost.\n\nWill trucking companies become their own power companies? Janus might be tempted to buy a solar farm near their rural battery swap stations. Let’s imagine their rural grid isn’t that reliable and / or cheap? They decide enough is enough. Land out there is cheap – so they install a huge solar farm. They buy extra batteries, and just charge their batteries during the day. Sure they have trucks swapping out batteries at night, but they’ve bought more batteries for that and just charge them all during the day. For them, it’s like buying their own oil refinery and getting off the world oil market once and for all!\n\nTHEN consider the money! Toll and Linfox and Auspost have serious MONEY to put into saving money long-term by investing in wind or solar farms around the place.\n\nTHEN consider that battery tech is still evolving. Imagine what will emerge in the coming years as BIG OIL money switches into BIG BATTERY!\n\nTHEN consider the geopolitical implications as ENORMOUS multinationals like Toll realise they can be seen as the good guys by not buying oil off all those countries that don’t like us very much, like the Middle Eastern Theocracies and Russian autocrats.\n\nTHEN consider whether you want your super anywhere near fossil fuel investments!",

    "selftext": "Re post from r/Adelaide because i wanted a wider range of answers. \n\nOk beautiful people, I want to pick your brains. (I wish to start a discussion on this and don't want it to come across as being a preacher)\n\nBoth sides of the big parties are talking about having large numbers of electric cars on the road by 2025 (its amazing to think thats just 6 years away). I think i heard the numbers are around 50 percent of cars on the road, up from the 0.2 percent that are currently on the road I (my numbers are arbitrary, just what i remember hearing on the radio during the day) so that means that half of people in Australia will be buying a brand new car in those 6 years. This is something i cant see myself being in a position to do and I'm not sure just how valid it is for other people.\n\nSecondly their is the thought (fact?) that the production of a new car will negate any of its green house gas savings for decades. I think the statement i heard was that an 1970s V8 would is more efficient due to the fact it already exists. The batteries for a brand new Toyota Prius travel multiple times around the world before they actually end up in a car (lithium is mined in Chile as well as other places). So while it might lower Australia's green house gas emissions, the overall emissions of the world will likely rise.\n\nA possible solution? Hydrogen  \nHydrogen is the most abundant substance in the universe. It can be easily using electricity and water. It can be used as a fuel source in a mostly unmodified petrol engine. When it burns it produces nothing but water as an emission. It can be refueled similar to LPG gasses.  \nWe could produce it in places where solar or wind power are prevalent such as the outback, instead of relying on the power grid to transport the energy stored. Send it to what are effectively petrol stations all over the country to be pumped directly into your car in a matter of minutes, ready to continue on your journey.\n\nSo why aren't we looking at it?",

    "selftext": "As titled.  I cant work it out.  Im looking for a 10y long-life smoke detector (in addition to the regulatory ones already installed in my home) to keep more areas in my home and family safe.  But for some reason they seem unnecessarily expensive.\n\nI refer you to Bunnings in NZ:  [Family Shield Photoelectric 10 Year Longlife Smoke Alarm - 2 Pack - Bunnings New Zealand](https://www.bunnings.co.nz/family-shield-photoelectric-10-year-longlife-smoke-alarm-2-pack_p8909662)\n\nThese are effectively $16 each.  In Oz, its minimum of twice that price.  Can anyone put a reasonable explanation as to why this is?  It seems ludicrous.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nBecause this has developed some controversy.  Please also refer to the Oz Bunnings equivalent:   [Fire Pro Photoelectric 10 Year Lithium Battery Smoke Alarm - Bunnings Australia](https://www.bunnings.com.au/fire-pro-photoelectric-10-year-lithium-battery-smoke-alarm_p4211417) \n\nFor all intents and purposes, this is exactly the same as the NZ ones list above.  And it has terrible reviews!  Yet its twice the price? I see no reason for this and *the entire industry seems to be priced accordingly (in AU)*.  Also, I don't care for interlinking.  I just don't need it.  And this basic Bunnings one does not have interlinking.\n\nAlso, cost does not equal quality.\n\nThanks for all the comments.\n\n&#x200B;",

I will however tell you the catalyst , SSRI medication.\nAfter spending a month in there being treated for schizofrenia with powerful medications ( Respirodone pills with a benzodiazepine and Largactil injections ) and being reduced to a slow moving , twitching drooling mess of a human being i managed to get out and wean myself off these medications enough to voice my opinion on the horrible state off affairs going on in that place. \nSome of the things i witnessed with regularity - \nVoluntary patients with good demeanour who were well behaved and just wanted a place to calm down for a while being forcibly injected within minutes of arrival and being left to stumble around the corridors until they pass out. \nHeroine addicts collecting centerlink and injecting drugs on there 1 to 2 hour leaves and coming back inside , At one point one individual actually snuck a needle in , injected himself , buried it in the garden then slept all day.\nIndian doctors laced with gold , and i mean LACED , the guy has gold glasses , gold watch , gold rings and gold necklaces , he is making serious coin , to bad he is not a good doctor and can hardly comprehend english. He changes people medications on a whim and people who had been on the same medications for long periods of time that were working would be placed on dual therapies or be swapped to a different drugs for no reason, this caused more then a few blow ups which led to more forced injections. As i was about to be released he kind of looked over to his assistant ( also indian ) and said okay start him on lithium... Despite the fact i was already taking numerous antipsychotics and basically couldnt think fast enough to communicate already.\n\nThe place is in disrepair badly , It smells , and there is no treatment option except having no control and being drugged repeatedly and frequently against your will ( there is no psychologist there at all). Has anyone else got any horror stories about public mental health care in nsw? I dont know who to talk to about what has happened and its been playing on my mind since i got out.\n",

    "selftext": "The US intervention into the Middle Eastern region was timely, and the synchronisation of damaging events that were a precursor to the lead up of the Invasion in Iraq were typical of peak oil events we were at a critical stage in the Global Economy. The developed world and its backbone were formed by the petro dollar and it’s hyper management and protection. The events of 9/11 were impetus enough, to convince the majority of well meaning audiences on TV to show rightful outrage at the level of conspiracy and follow through to commit heinous acts, by a group of well heeled Saudi factions that had rightfully predicted a coming of times that was directed at US influence in the region, where a rightful attitude for free liberty and a reign of dominance, was important in maintaining a constant oil supply, to supply to the free world with it’s all important lifeblood. With trickle down profits that were assured to bring peace to opposing tribes, and sub religions, and setting up infrastructures through overseas investment and the construction of planned supercities it was a wise move in providing future generations with a seemingly steady supply of revenue for when oil derricks eventually ran dry. A future hedge on wise investment to provide future generations their rightful payback for a resource that belonged to them. This was an important priority for leaders, and sinking funds, to provide a way of life for the 218 million inhabitants of a less than arable land mass that could not sustain life in the long term and was dated architecturally with little in the way of utilities and infrastructure. Instead the oil exported revenue funded and tunnelled surplus arms left over from the post Cold War era that supplied leaders of the middle east with attractive weapons contracts, thus protecting them from opposing dictators throughout a long history of peace attempts, these could only be classed as a cold blooded mercenary tactic in any observer's eye. The need for an arms race, and historical purchases over the long history of domestic and civil conflict in the region was a major roadblock for the intervening forces to expedite a peaceful solution to the middle easter conflict, without being drawn into a protracted and costly war that served a dual purpose in dismantling freedom limiting regimes and ensuring oil conglomerates and their international contracts were maintained, within the respective continent and without local pressures bringing any concerns to the free running of an institutionalized system that produced millions of barrels per day. Modern society was built upon the need to commute, transport and generate, with oil being dependent on so many economies, slowly powering a marvel to our quality of lives that brought a modern rendering to science, medicine, goods, services, technology and travel, it appears to be obvious the redistribution of these intangible gains have yet to benefit the Middle East. The negative public image, and the effect of over a decade of hostile raids, and alleged peace plans that were to leave an ever present scar on forward progress are a reminder of the peaceful culture that produced oil at the price of bottled water, a marvel at their ability for keeping production rates so high, and the cost so affordable for such an expendable and limited commodity, that was to be a future hedge for development. The widespread breakdown of civil order has benefited this old civilization in the way of migration patterns that will include the developed world as a pathway to play host to well educated migrants who bring with them the down to earth skills and niceties necessary for cultural enrichment, the main benefactors of this social integration will be the benign agitators and their negligence in protesting the atrocities seen on television in stopping the mass slaughter of innocent civilians, in short we ignored them. The liberations to be had in the advancement of primitive and oppressive practices relating to religion, governance, and a way of life that was encapsulated, and enforced by possessive regimes would lead to the most costly conflict of all known time that was to remove the glut of capitalism from the free world and become an unexpected consequence of new globalist agendas and human greed, with the world hitting the limits of excesses and taking advantage of outsourced labor, the cost to the western world may have been worth the toll of the the high defense budget blowouts and the failed high technology investments into the war machine that never made their battle field debut, an appropriate redirection of left over wealth and a saviour to earth friendly consumables, in short it shorted the money supply that was causing death. Extremism was to be a tool to bring psychological awareness, to an underfunded and equipped network of alliances that with all peaceful intent, was to the bain of our freedom though necessary at the time from the protagonists view, the dark methods employed by so called terrorists were successful in bringing awareness to the genocidal practices carried out by foreign forces in their own lands, and were the only logical way of pointing out the disparity between a multi trillion dollar goliath, and a disenfranchised enemy, the human toll that resulted in a legacy of fear would have been best allocated to the rebuilding, and investment of peace through the various UN branches that might have brought about a more peaceful ending or even rapid advancement to human development, a case in point would be the stability seen in many middle eastern countries, that were traditionally run by well meaning leaders who held total power but had a firm but fair grip on their citizens tumultuous history of differences. The covert nature of arms exports into crisis areas was not exposed to a fair extent with fields of support and heavy equipment covering landing zones, a bulk of the global economy was siphoned into this boiling pot, that was kept under lid by a co-ordinated planting of events, falsely prioritised and factually weak, to further blur the lines of real world happenings that were manipulated to keep hegemonic interests alive, and with the disarmament of both sides due to fatigue, and waning public interest, in supporting the ongoing entanglement. Figureheads would rise to public support for the occasion and retire with a death stare at the domino effect of their actions, a shellshock to any decent human being and their legacy. A picture became clearer, that the key strategies to the successful withdrawal of peacekeeping forces and rebuilding teams, that include incentives that cater to the average displaced families and survivors of the aftermath of decades of terror, and the provision of funds and overseas exit routes, to at risk individuals who may have been active in plotting for both sides a lesson in harm reduction, and promoting the wellbeing of innocents who have been disadvantaged by a resource hungry timeline of events, that has caused widows and parentless children. With the tail end of destabilisation this has brought about an inflammation of religious upheaval, to Northern African states who are fickle to the rule of law and are sensitive to small changes to the delicate system that upholds the very necessaries of life, a case in example is the Sudan region where we have seen collateral damage to over 300,000 innocent people, and in all certainty the resources needed to curb these statistics have been depleted by the withdrawal of changing presidents and governments, and the isolated nature of events and priorities in media related content, the world focus has been taken off the spotlight of where the remnants of hostilities and injustices remain. The flow on effect from years of border crossings, and inflaming of local populations within Pakistan has brought about outrage and a spread of extremism to surrounding countries including the Kashmir region, where India has always been a neutral party to the events happening in the Middle East, an injustice to peaceful governance and the retiring exit of specialist operations in the region, that were handling the situation without stirring the semi brokered peace deals found in Afghanistan. More immediate solutions to the Middle Eastern Crisis could include temporary transit programmes, that might see secure holiday camps with friendly backdrops and spectacular outings, to remove the brainwashing and in calculation of doctrines of the past, that have caused the weak willed to partake in extraordinary feats of determinism and self sacrifice. Destinations should include the myriad of coveted cities that were known to support the demagogues, so as to bring a closure and an experience that may allow for less combat oriented operations and future development of specialized weaponry for sand based theatres, and the training and risk of life to third parties who have become sandwiched between a meeting of superpowers and the best course of action. An immersive experience into the reasons for such dramatic consequences of intervention in the first place, will bring an understanding to why persona non grata lists were created in the first place, and holding education programmes to further ensure that the imparted wisdom is fresh and colorful, and would be relayed back to a world where it’s focus has been on retribution where explanations are needed, as to why so called role model societies had such murderous intent in the middle east. The dignitaries of this special treatment would feel indebted to this gratitude and ensure the mutual success of general peace, and synergy in bringing an end to history’s most exclusive display of madness and insignia motivated career climbing. With a non binding contract ensured to these devotees to a Western View of life this may prevent resource wars from ever escalating beyond discussion tables and responsible policy makers in the future. To beguile such efforts would throw a spanner in the works for the future of white petroleum, that is known as Lithium and there is an estimated 13 million tons, worldwide primarily found in South America where the price to date, has doubled and is forecasted rise at rates which may bring about economic revolution, if managed correctly, or be the downfall of certain countries with an over liquidation of revenue causing the expected inequality and its associated degeneracy. The average weight of the rechargeable battery component found in a Tesla vehicle is half a ton without bringing into account the many other appliances that use the lifecycle durabilities found in Lithium that keeps the digital world alive and this coupled with a limited resource is a worrying sign of the times for a repeat of the aforementioned and the scope of its consumers who are passively funding an unknown quantity giving meaning to “next generation”. International based Lithium mining companies give priority to ethical practices and responsible profit sharing, to the sourced countries who give consent and typically represent the establishment, a core importance to industry and commercial ventures who are professional about mitigating future risk, and managing associated derivative markets. Looking at Chile as a case example, that has the largest earning potential being the biggest stakeholder of Lithium reserves, with 7.5 million tonnes a game changing role model to emergent vehicle manufacturers, who owe climate change sceptics a performance in typical purchasing habits and ensuring green energy subsidies and its uptake is enhanced and made to benefit newcomers to their full potential. The Exported profits of Lithium should come a range of awareness programs that might include social spending programs, and campaigns that may avoid the future possibility of out of control cash flow spending, and the dangers associated with inequality and societal degeneracy that could have been avoided by better planning and public knowledge, of the scarce but valuable commodity that is set to bring major investment into the region, a worst case scenario would be interference or even conflict in the region by the world demand for this extremely valuable alternative to oil, thank you playing your role in promoting these important messages and taking the time to appreciate the energy sector and the range of issues that have caused humanity an untold death toll.",

It doesn’t go any faster than 25Km/H. However it appears that some places, like Quebec, insist on turn-signals, which it does not have.\n\nI know these need a license plate in China and wonder whether provinces like Ontario has similar requirements. \n\nThanks everyone, would also really appreciate any freight or moving companies you’d recommend for a small delivery like this.",

If they have investments of course we ensure their safety. Their safety is very important for us,” he said by phone.\n\n**Suhail also said the Taliban would no longer allow China’s Uyghur separatist fighters,** some of whom had previously sought refuge in Afghanistan, to enter the country. The Taliban would also prevent al-Qaeda or any other terrorist group from operating there.\n\n[ Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen. Photo: Handout](https://preview.redd.it/f0eravrg2ca71.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3c6808e85015df7498c606a98f94a30cf26897a)\n\nThe interview comes as the Taliban advances in Afghanistan’s northern provinces following the near-complete withdrawal of US troops from the country. US intelligence agencies believe the government in Kabul is now likely to collapse within six months of the withdrawal, allowing the Taliban back into power 20 years after it was overthrown.\n\nThe US invaded the country after the September 11, 2001 attacks carried out by al-Qaeda in New York and Washington, claiming the Taliban had been sheltering the terrorist group.\n\nSuhail said following the departure of US troops it was “necessary \\[to\\] hold talks” with China, the biggest investor in Afghanistan.\n\n**“We have been to China many times and we have good relations with them,” Suhail said.** “China is a friendly country that we welcome for reconstruction and developing Afghanistan.” \n\n## If [the Chinese] have investments of course we ensure their safety. --Suhail Shaheen, Taliban spokesman\n\nAfghanistan has the world’s largest unexploited reserves of copper, coal, iron, gas, cobalt, mercury, gold, lithium and thorium, valued at over US$1 trillion. \n\nIn 2011, the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) won a US$400 million bid to drill three oil fields for 25 years, containing roughly 87 million barrels of oil.\n\nChinese firms have also gained rights to mine copper at Mes Aynak in Logar province, some 40km southeast of Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul.\n\n### Committed to Doha deal\n\nChina blames a separatist Uygur group that it refers to as the East Turkestan \n\n[Islamic Movement](https://www.scmp.com/topics/islamic-militancy-0) (ETIM) for terrorist acts in its restive western province of [Xinjiang](https://www.scmp.com/topics/xinjiang).\n\nWhile some experts have cast doubt on whether a group with that name exists, it is widely accepted that in the 1990s some Uygurs left China for Afghanistan with the intention of establishing a guerilla insurgency. The US removed ETIM from its list of terrorist organisations last year, drawing the ire of China.\n\n“People from other countries who want to use Afghanistan as a site \\[to launch attacks\\] against other countries, we have made a commitment that we will not allow them in whether it’s an individual or entity against any country including China,” said Suhail.\n\n[ Armed men who are opposed to the Taliban’s return at a check post in the Ghorband District, Parwan Province, Afghanistan.

We are abiding by that agreement,” said Suhail, referring to the peace deal the group signed with the United States in February 2020 in Doha that paved the way for the withdrawal.\n\nAsked specifically whether this commitment included the ETIM, he said: “Yes, it will not be allowed in”.\n\nSuhail also said al-Qaeda belonged to a “past era” and would not be allowed to operate in the country any more.\n\nHe said the Taliban had “inherited al-Qaeda” from the former government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani when al-Qaeda swept into Afghanistan in the nineties. The Taliban overthrew Rabbani’s government in 1996.\n\n“We allowed \\[al-Qaeda\\] to stay in Afghanistan because they had no place in any other country.”\n\nBut he claimed there were now no longer any al-Qaeda members in Afghanistan and insisted that under the Doha peace deal the Taliban had “committed ourselves that we will not allow” any individual, group or entity to use Afghanistan to carry out attacks against the US, its allies or “any other country in the world”.\n\n“We will not permit any open recruitment or any training or fundraising centre for any group in Afghanistan,” said Suhail. “If there is one who is hiding and we find them, we will tell them they cannot \\[stay\\].”\n\n \n\n### A longstanding relationship\n\nAndrew Small, a senior transatlantic fellow with the German Marshall Fund’s Asia Programme, said China’s relationship with the Taliban was “longstanding”, going back to the group’s time in government. The Taliban ruled the country from 1996 to 2001.\n\n“I first wrote about it many years back when I became aware of the secret meetings that had been taking place in Pakistan even after the US invasion and before other countries’ contacts with the Taliban had been normalised,” said Small.\n\nChina had in one sense been a “friend” by maintaining diplomatic contacts with the Taliban, he said.\n\nHowever, he said that now China would “be very cautious about any new investments or commitments to Afghanistan”.\n\n“Whatever benign language the Taliban use, China remains highly concerned about the security situation there,” said Small.\n\nHe said China’s biggest concern in its dealings with the Taliban had always been whether it was sheltering Uygur separatists. \n\n## Whatever benign language the Taliban use, China remains highly concerned about the security situation there. -- Andrew Small, German Marshall Fund’s Asia Programme\n\nIn the late 1990s, Beijing worried that the Taliban government was providing a haven for Uygur militants who had fled Chinese crackdowns in Xinjiang and set up training camps in Afghanistan.\n\nAn understanding between China and the Taliban on the Uygur issue dated back to Beijing’s exchanges with Mullah Omar, the late leader of the Taliban who died in 2013, said Small.\n\n“How strictly the Taliban are willing or capable of enforcing this understanding is a separate question though – there have always been doubts about that on Beijing’s part, which is one of the many reasons why, even though they have reached these agreements with the Taliban, there is a lot of trepidation about them on China’s part,” said Small.\n\nBeijing was also concerned about security risks spilling over into its own territory because Afghanistan shares a 90km border with Xinjiang.\n\nOn Thursday, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the problems in Afghanistan were practical challenges facing both China and Pakistan.\n\n“China, along with Pakistan, is willing to continue support for all parties in Afghanistan to seek a political solution through dialogue that leads to ethnic reconciliation and long-lasting peace,” Wang said.\n\n[An Afghan National Army soldier stands guard at the gate of Bagram US air base, on the day the last American troops vacated it.

The Pentagon says the withdrawal of US forces is 90 per cent complete.\n\nAfghan government forces, no longer backed by US-led Nato troops, have shown signs of collapsing, with soldiers abandoning their posts, and have often had to retreat, at times into neighbouring countries like Tajikistan.\n\nWashington agreed to withdraw in a deal negotiated last year under President Joe Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump.\n\nBiden overruled military leaders who wanted to keep a larger presence to assist Afghan security forces and prevent Afghanistan from becoming a staging ground for extremist groups. In April, he ordered all US forces to withdraw by September 11, the 20th anniversary of the al-Qaeda attacks.\n\nThe commander of US troops in Afghanistan, General Austin Miller, warned last week that the country may be headed towards a civil war.\n\n \n\nThe US intelligence community believes the Afghan military is weak and that the Kabul government’s prospects for survival in the short term are not good. But the idea of the Taliban in power has also stoked fears among women that they will once again be oppressed, stopped from working and that young girls will be banned from going to school. Rights groups said Taliban insurgents had forced people out of their homes in northern areas that they had captured and have expressed concern for the safety of women.\n\nSuhail claimed girls would be allowed in classrooms.\n\n“In the districts that we control, schools are open and girls are allowed to attend,” he said.\n\nHe also appealed to the international community for financial assistance to help pay teachers, civil servants and local officials.\n\n“The Kabul government has stopped paying their salaries ... in the areas that we control,” he said.\n\n^(This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Taliban urges China to invest in Afghanistan)",

I've been doing a fair bit of research myself but it'd be nice to get some opinions in English to help me along the way. This seems like the place to do it since many on this forum talk about riding them.\n\n1- What would you guys consider a reasonable price for a daily driver e-bike? Naturally I want something that has good acceleration, a good top speed and that can travel quite far between recharges, but the price range is pretty wide.\n\n2- Perhaps my most difficult-to-meet desire is that I want one that can go 150km on one charge, under realistic everyday speeds and road conditions. This will drive the price up more than any other factor. Is it reasonable for a first e-bike or would you recommend looking downmarket for a starter bike?\n\n3- I'm aware that most e-bikes are virtually identical on the inside when you take their shape and battery out of the equation, but what makes do you recommend? Most bikes here in Changsha seem to be Limas but there are also a lot of Qingjies and I've read good things about Lvjia online. Which is the best quality?\n\n4- I've seen that some very low top speeds are mandated by law virtually everywhere, including here. If I buy a bike directly from the manufacturer's store, will it be limited to this speed? What kind of place would I have to go to get rid of the limiter?\n\nThanks.",

Brazil has shown the world the potential of the bioethanol and honestly the only reason why I suspect that the entire:\n\n* solar panel\n* wind energy\n* electro battery\n\nstuff is pushed is because that these things despite claiming to be very eco-friendly, they still require rare and finite resources like lithium, cobalt (even grandmas today know that cobalt is mined by child slaves in Congo, it's like one source so it's hard to hide), etc. Objectively, there just isn't enough of this stuff to give everyone an electric car for example.\n\nBrazil is world's biggest producer after USA and most importantly it has an objectively better sugarcane ethanol instead of maize-based one in USA. It has something like 5x times better \"energy input - energy output\" ratio and is extremely good for environment.\n\nAnd most importantly - bioethanol DOESN'T need rare resources that are just not enough for everybody - you can't give everyone solar panels/wind energy/electro battery and even nuclear power plants are technically finite in fuel such as uranium/thorium.\n\nThis is just my guess, but if the world really wanted to go \"green\" and save environment - and I say this as not some kind of Brazil fan, even if I would hate Brazil I would have to face the facts - that it is either Brazil or India that would be the only 2 practical states where you can get enough of bioethanol produced for the world's demand to be fulfilled.\n\nSo, I think it is politics why this never happened. Because then Brazil/India would become the duopoly on world's clean and renewable fuel and from moral perspective you can't even criticize it.\n\nBut we live in a political world, so I think bioethanol never took off because countries like USA/EU/China/Japan and others don't want to be dependent on bioethanol despite it being objectively the best eco-friendly fuel.\n\nOnly sugarcane bioethanol is best one out there and only Brazil, India, and maybe in few other places in small quantities can you make enough of it.\n\nAnyways, Brazil, I respect you very much for the world's pioneering of bioethanol and I think Embraer is also your nation's great pride.\n\nEdit: Also, oil producers would also be against bioethanol since E85 or E100 would completely kill their revenue. So, Brazil is basically countered by too many interests who don't want either for bioethanol to even exist or to depend on Brazil and/or India",

Many Zimbabweans have resorted to solar energy to power their homes as most of the times we go for up to 15 hours without electricity, but it comes with a lot of safety issues most people are unaware of. Lithium batteries have become the preferred choice for home solar energy storage. However, improper installation or usage can lead to safety risks, including thermal runaway and fire hazards. So we are going to explore which technology is best and safe from the solar panels to the batteries in the solar setup.\n\nOne thing that’s consistent in Zimbabwe is the inconsistency of electricity, things just seem to get better at the end of the month and then things just go back to default so it’s no surprise everyone is now going for back up plans.  For those who have a backup or are planning on getting a back up, there is a few things you need to know when installing a solar system.",

    "selftext": "Zimbabwe has the largest lithium reserves in Africa and is among the top lithium producers in the world.  Until recently, though, the nation hadn’t really been cashing in.  Lithium exports have grown tremendously over the years, rising from $1.8 million in 2018 to $70 million in 2022 - and to a staggering $209 in the first nine months of 2023.  Last December, the Zimbabwean government banned the export of raw lithium to encourage investment in local processing facilities.\n\nIt approved a lithium-ore policy to consolidate the country's beneficiation strategy, meant to push miners to agree to smelt their output on Zimbabwean soil rather than export raw material overseas.  Chinese firms - including Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, Sinomine Resource Group, Chengxin Lithium Group, Yahua Group and Canmax Technologies - have spent more than $1 billion over the past two years on acquiring and developing lithium projects in the country.\n\nCash-strapped Zimbabwe has been buckling under the weight of Western sanctions but is increasingly looking to the mining sector, which contributes almost 20% to the country’s $66 billion GDP, to help solve its budgetary constraints.  Lithium is set to become the nation’s third-biggest mineral export after gold and platinum, which registered $2.46 billion and $2.27 billion respectively in export receipts last year.\n\nA decade ago, President Robert Mugabe made headlines by forcing the country’s platinum miners to refine their product in-country, rather than exporting raw material for processing in South Africa, in return for a sweetened deal on an indigenisation law that required mining firms to hand over a majority of their shares to Black Zimbabweans.  It appears Zimbabwe is finally starting to live up to its potential.\n\nLet us know your thoughts in the comments.",

We have air forces and (bizarrely) naval forces here in our military body. They are not present at the safe-to-infer coup attempt besides infantry forces\n* They eventually ~~enter~~ force themselves into the main government building, el palacio quemado\n* Once inside, **Zuñiga** - general of the military at the moment, enters and talks with the current president, Luis 'Lucho' Arce, backed with the strength of the bolivian infantry behind him\n* *~~I think their talk is recorded on video because Arce and Zuñiga meet at the lobby, not so far from where the media and curious eyes can see and record, but idk~~*\n* Zuñiga becomes ex general of the military, he is arrested by the military complex (outside of police and civil law)\n* He \\[Zuñiga\\] gives a public discourse about defending democracy or something, boilerplate political discourse, doesn't matter **Except one bit about liberating political prisoners and that Evo \\[ex president of Bolivia and** [famous huevo](http://img.desmotivaciones.es/201911/amistad-imagenes-28.jpg)**\\] can't be president again, more on that later**\n* Another military general is appointed by chain of command. An order is given to return to base. The troops slowly go back\n* Arce is still the president\n* Arce gives a boilerplate discourse about defending democracy and stuff, you know the drill\n* Many other public institutions go to social media and live tv/radio to publicly condemn the coup attempt and offer support for 'compañero/hermano' Arce\n   * Some people go way to far with the flattery\n* Celebrations are currently ongoing as of this moment, about defending democracy or something\n* ... Later, **Zuñiga goes on camera to say that this was solicited and orquestated by Arce, to save face because something bad is about to happen this week** **~~\\[allegedly\\]~~**\n   * \"Why 'allegedly'? I just saw a video of this in this sub a moment ago!\" I know! But I can't verify it though, the clip is from the tv channel unitel and they usually upload their stuff. However, the clip uploaded here in this sub start at hours 19:01, and the [oficial VOD of unitel today](https://www.youtube.com/live/pNkLWOSLrhM?feature=shared) cuts around 19:00\n      * Not all hope is lost! In the clip, unitel is making an overlay of the transmision of another channel, bolivia tv. Fortunately, we have confirmation that the clip is real because bolivia tv uploaded [the full vod of today!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgHjx8ZlddM), go to approx the timestamp 3:47:00, or [just use this link](https://www.youtube.com/live/QgHjx8ZlddM?feature=shared&t=13611)\n      * It should be noted that because these are just reuploads of the whole day, the content is completely in spanish\n\nShould be noted that since the very beginning of this events, the whole population was in a PANIC. Most of people here had experience before with military dictatorships from the last century and markets and gas stations are full of people. This was a huge scare for the country because so many people lost so much in the dictatorships before\n\n~~This day worked both as a fake flag and as a terrorism act~~\n\nEdit: New development: government officials deny the accusation of Zuñiga and have \\[alleged\\] proof about that. I'll cover that later\n\nAlso realized that taking for granted the answer of a \\[alleged\\] coup leader, Zuñiga, at face value is incredibly stupid. I will write more about weather this is a fake flag or not later (im tired) but honestly? It's too early to tell for sure, and while the topic is hot it's just so hard to navigate the turmoil. I'll do my best\n\nEdit 2: Turns out that Zuñiga and Arce did meet earlier this week, to play footbal (soccer) in a school. I'm not making this up, this is very common here. Maybe they talked about something there but it's not clear. Probably it will never be, because who would make an official order to fake coup and leave evidence of it? Aside from that, it seems like Zuñiga was laid down just a day before the events. So, that's +1 point to Zuñiga trying to coup I guess? Still not enough to make a coup attempt without support, in comments I wrote about why I think this was a fake flag",

Since then Carvajal has embarked on a [winter vigil](https://twitter.com/LosTiemposBol/status/1675678667253456904) that has now lasted over 40 days. She managed to climb the [terrace of APDHB's offices](https://www.opinion.com.bo/articulo/pais/40-dias-vigilia-amparo-carvajal-sube-escalera-entra-oficinas-apdhb/20230711144539913428.html) and faces countless challenges. The squatters continue to show their true colors by denying her food and basic necessities, [refusing access to the bathroom](https://twitter.com/BrujulaNoticias/status/1679123424910749699), and even subjecting her to sleep deprivation through [loud music](https://twitter.com/albarracin_fra/status/1678974472726953984) blaring all night long. Despite dehydration and hypertension, Amparo refuses to back down. Her fight has gained national attention and the support of [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/es/documents/amr18/6937/2023/en/). Not happy with harassing Carvajal, the shock groups have resorted to physically [attacking the press](https://erbol.com.bo/seguridad/la-anpb-repudia-ataques-la-prensa-durante-el-conflicto-por-la-asamblea-de-derechos-humanos) for covering their outrageous behavior.  I would like to send these guys in a submarine tour of the titanic.\n\n**The Corpse of the Fictitious 2019 Coup Takes Another Beating**\n\nIn the never-ending saga of the fictitious 2019 coup, [two MAS congresspeople](https://www.lostiempos.com/actualidad/pais/20230705/2019-evo-instruyo-cob-al-pacto-unidad-que-pidan-su-renuncia-legisladores), Andres Flores and Deysi Choque, have made new revelations. They say Evo Morales had asked the powerful COB union (through its president Juan Carlos Huarachi) to publicly demand his resignation back in 2019. This revelation is consistent with [former Senate president Adriana Salvatierra's statement from 2020](https://twitter.com/Gabriel83138304/status/1677035653538750464), which was key as Salvatierra's resignation allowed ex-president Jeanine Añez to be the next person in line to the presidential succession. Now, here's the twist: Evo made this request before he even departed for El Chapare, from where he eventually resigned. It seems Evo had already made up his mind to resign, and the military's request for his resignation came later. The coup conspiracy theorists might need to find another hobby, as it appears that almost everyone and their mother was calling for Evo's resignation in 2019. When the COB joined the chorus on live TV, it effectively sealed the deal. Now, MAS members are engaging in name-calling, [with Huarachi being branded a 'Judas'](https://erbol.com.bo/nacional/ala-%E2%80%98evista%E2%80%99-tilda-de-%E2%80%98judas%E2%80%99-huarachi-y-arremete-contra-dirigentes-que-respaldan-al) for supporting President Arce instead of Evo. So Haurachi’s backers are reminding Evo that Huarachi was only following Evo’s own orders. Interestingly Huarachi [has not denied](https://brujuladigital.net/politica/huarachi-elude-responder-si-evo-le-solicito-que-le-pidiera-la-renuncia-eso-queda-entre-nosotros) getting those instructions from Evo, stating only that that conversion “will stay between us”.\n\n**Good Night and Good Luck: Pagina Siete Signs Off**\n\nIn a devastating blow to Bolivia's freedom of the press and democracy, the [popular newspaper Pagina Siete has ceased operations](https://www.paginasiete.bo/sociedad/fin-del-camino-carta-a-los-lectores-de-pagina-siete-XK8387415). For years the administration and the MAS have been playing their power games, targeting and silencing media outlets they don't control. They've been busy collecting scalps, ranging from newspapers to TV channels to radio stations. But the closure of Pagina Siete hits hardest. It's like witnessing a game of \"Whack-a-Journalist\" on steroids. The authorities resorted to threatening the paper's advertisers for placing ads, publicly attacking its integrity, and using that old authoritarian playbook by labeling them \"enemies of the people.\" And let's not forget those excessive audits, which conveniently seem to target only those media outlets that don't parrot the government's talking points. [As per the ANP](https://twitter.com/grupoeldeber/status/1674813332866449414) (National Association of the Press) this is a strategy of the central government against those who dare to stray from the party line. It's a dark day indeed, where freedom of the press takes a hit and humor takes a backseat.\n\n**Flash round: Quick Laughs and Headshakes**\n\n* Evo's math skills took center stage during his live show, \"Evo is the People, Leader of The Humble.\" Despite being corrected by his guest, who used a calculator, [Evo couldn't seem to provide consistent answers](https://twitter.com/LosTiemposBol/status/1678191245707952129) when discussing the current prices and sale of lithium carbonate. It's never too late to go back to school buddy.\n* Moody's changed Bolivia's economic rating to [\"negative\"](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/latest/Moody-s-Changes-Bolivia-s-Outlook-to-Negative--44245884/), citing a lack of foreign currency and short-term solutions to liquidity issues. Wonder why? Oh, right, deforestation records, questionable economic policies, and a lack of math skills. Oops!\n* Teodoro Mamani, the director of the National Service of Protected Areas, [not only impregnated one of his employees but also fired her](https://www.noticiasfides.com/justicia/director-del-sernap-recontrato-a-funcionaria-que-embarazo-pero-la-mantiene-aislada-y-sin-funciones) after she refused to abort the pregnancy. She filed a sexual harassment complaint, and the ensuing public embarrassment finally caused the government to fire Mamani. Better late than never, I guess.\n* Mamani's questionable decisions don't end there; last year [he also authorized miners to enter protected areas](https://www.eldiario.net/portal/2022/11/03/sernap-admite-acuerdo-con-cooperativas-para-la-explotacion-de-areas-protegidas/). This guy penetrates everything in sight!\n* VP Choquehunaca went on a [non-drunken tirade against city folk](https://www.noticiasfides.com/nacional/politica/algunos-ni-lavarse-la-cabeza-saben-choquehuanca-dice-que-los-citadinos-son-bien-flojos), calling them \"lazy\" and criticizing their hair-washing skills. Time to invest in some dry shampoo folks! He later issued an apology, presumably after realizing that offending a majority of voters wasn't the smartest move.",

    "selftext": "La industrialización del litio en Bolivia se ha convertido en un tema candente, dada la abundancia de este mineral en el país. Con las mayores reservas de litio en el mundo, Bolivia debería ser un candidato ideal para liderar la producción y aprovechar los beneficios económicos asociados. Sin embargo, la realidad presenta un panorama menos que alentador.\n\nA pesar de una inversión considerable de aproximadamente mil millones de dólares, los resultados de la industrialización del litio en Bolivia han dejado mucho que desear, según un informe de Los tiempos [https://www.lostiempos.com/actualidad/economia/20230907/industrializar-litio-se-invirtieron-us-1000-mm-pero-logros-son-pocos](https://www.lostiempos.com/actualidad/economia/20230907/industrializar-litio-se-invirtieron-us-1000-mm-pero-logros-son-pocos). Aunque se han erigido diversas infraestructuras destinadas a la producción de litio, como la planta de cloruro de potasio y la fábrica de baterías de litio, estas instalaciones están lejos de operar a su capacidad máxima. Para empeorar las cosas, la planta industrial de carbonato de litio, que debería estar en funcionamiento, aún no ha sido entregada.\n\nEn un artículo de The Diplomat [https://thediplomat.com/2023/07/china-begins-lithium-extraction-increases-mining-investment-in-bolivia/](https://thediplomat.com/2023/07/china-begins-lithium-extraction-increases-mining-investment-in-bolivia/), se destaca la ambiciosa meta de Bolivia de extraer 25,000 toneladas de litio al año, con la esperanza de alcanzar las 50,000 toneladas anuales para 2025 a través de un acuerdo con CBC. Sin embargo, las críticas no se hacen esperar, ya que se argumenta que la capacidad tecnológica de la industria de litio boliviana es insuficiente, permitiendo extraer solo la mitad de la cantidad planeada.\n\nAdemás, el informe arroja luz sobre las operaciones mineras chinas en América Latina, acusándolas de causar daños ambientales y de ignorar las regulaciones destinadas a proteger el entorno y los derechos de las comunidades indígenas. La presencia creciente de China en la región también ha desencadenado tensiones sociales, políticas y culturales entre los recién llegados trabajadores chinos y la población local boliviana.  \n\n\nLa movida del litio en Bolivia tiene tropiezos. Aunque han metido mucha plata, las cosas no van como esperaban. Las fábricas no están a tope, y la prometida planta de carbonato de litio ni siquiera ha arrancado.\n\nY ojo, la meta de sacar 50,000 toneladas al año suena bonito, pero dicen por ahí que la tecnología boliviana solo da para la mitad. Además, las operaciones chinas no están caídas del cielo; están dejando huella en el ambiente y generando roces con la gente local.\n\nEn fin, toca repensar el plan. No solo se trata de producir más, sino de hacerlo sin arruinar el ambiente y respetando a la comunidad. ¿Será que logran equilibrar todo esto? El futuro de la movida del litio en Bolivia pinta interesante, pero hay que sortear estos baches para que la cosa funcione de verdad.",

    "selftext": " [https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/02/13/bolivia-politics-left-socialist-rift-morales-arce-president-election/](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/02/13/bolivia-politics-left-socialist-rift-morales-arce-president-election/)\n\n>Morales controls the structure and political direction of the MAS as party leader, and he has the support of his ex-ministers, who do not have positions in the current government. Among the populace, he provokes [strong feelings](https://www.urgente.bo/noticia/encuesta-diagnosis-evo-morales-mantiene-el-apoyo-del-30-de-la-poblaci%25C3%25B3n-boliviana) in both directions: One survey from last December found that 26 percent of respondents thought he could still be a good president, while 66 percent believed the opposite. Many Bolivians are put off by his desire to hold onto power. But he has a strong base among rural workers’ unions, not least the coca growers of the tropics, whose federation he leads as president. “Morales has a kind of gravitational pull in the rural workers’ world,” said Fernando García Yapur, a Bolivian political analyst. “And then Morales is also seen as a reference for progressivism—not just at the level of the continent but the world.”  \n>  \n>Arce lacks Morales’s charisma and social base, but many Bolivians see him as a safe bet to guide the economy—a perception fed by Bolivia’s strong growth during Morales’s governments, when Arce was the economy minister, and its remarkably low [inflation rate](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/12/22/inflation-bolivia-south-america-economy/) since he became president. This was the main reason given by respondents when Arce’s approval ratings approached [50 percent](https://www.paginasiete.bo/nacional/encuesta-sube-al-47-el-respaldo-al-presidente-arce-CB4146613) last September. But Arce’s handling of the census conflict—and then the arrest of Camacho—appeared unpopular: By the end of 2022, his approval ratings had tumbled to [26 percent](https://www.lostiempos.com/actualidad/pais/20230104/detencion-camacho-cae-aprobacion-arce-al-nivel-mas-su-gestion).  \n>  \n>Primaries for the MAS to choose its presidential candidate are set to take place in 2024. But the tension may come to a head before then. After the passing of the census law, Arce gave a speech in which he criticized “those among my own ranks who want to cut short my mandate,” alluding to his [supporters’ suspicion](https://www.lapoliticaonline.com/internacionales/crisis-en-bolivia-en-el-entorno-de-arce-denuncian-un-intento-de-golpe-de-evo/) that Morales’s camp would perhaps prefer to create the conditions for a change of leadership as soon as this year. This could theoretically happen through a [*revocatoria*](https://www.la-razon.com/nacional/2023/01/27/la-eventual-revocatoria-de-arce-requiere-mas-del-551-de-votos/), a constitutional mechanism that can allow citizens to vote to depose a president and trigger new elections—a possibility raised by [various supporters](https://www.noticiasfides.com/nacional/politica/evista-advierte-que-arce-esta-en-camino-de-su-revocatorio-por-sus-acciones-contra-el-pueblo-420442) of Morales. Two weeks ago, [audio](https://erbol.com.bo/nacional/un-audio-atribuido-evo-para-buscar-supuestamente-el-revocatorio-de-arce-genera-nuevas) was released by a Bolivian TV channel in which Morales appeared to discuss it, though he has claimed the audio was manipulated.  \n>  \n>The problems for governance created by these tensions may only get worse. The decision by MAS legislators loyal to Morales to vote against Arce’s government on the census law—and also, at first, the [2023 budget](https://www.paginasiete.bo/nacional/evistas-condicionan-aprobacion-del-pge-2023-creemos-dice-que-los-masistas-se-dedicaron-a-enfrentarse-en-la-sesion-IG5558381)—could be just the start. Then there is speculation that the MAS may [expel](https://www.opinion.com.bo/articulo/pais/evaluan-expulsion-arce-mas-vice-insiste-renovacion/20230118231857894449.html) Arce from the party or that Arce may jump ship and run as candidate for the [Partido Socialista-1](https://www.la-razon.com/nacional/2022/11/17/el-ps-1-abre-las-puertas-para-que-luis-arce-sea-su-candidato-en-2025/), a left-wing party that he was associated with as a student. If Arce and Morales do end up running for different parties and therefore splitting the MAS vote, then it could mark the end of a 20-year cycle in Bolivian politics, in which the MAS has been able to govern almost without need for compromise, and perhaps signal a return to an array of smaller, more issue-specific parties jostling and bargaining for power.\n\nJust summarize in the last year or so, the evistas (also known as the “radical” wing of the party) and the arcistas (known as the “renovators” within the party), have been accusing each other of:\n\n· Corruption\n\n· Narcotrafficking\n\n· “traitors to the people”\n\nAnd more. Just this morning an Evista congressman is accusing president Arce’s son of corruption regarding the recent lithium contracts and says he will bring criminal charges against him. \n\n[https://twitter.com/BrujulaNoticias/status/1625520406454050818?s=20&t=4fK5\\_XyhHXk7ZeEsD3l6jQ](https://twitter.com/BrujulaNoticias/status/1625520406454050818?s=20&t=4fK5_XyhHXk7ZeEsD3l6jQ) \n\nEvo’s camp has also been calling Arce a traitor for hinting the latter's candidacy to the 2025 elections. For those of you that follow US politics, this is giving me Trump vs DeSantis vibes. \n\n[https://brujuladigital.net/politica/evistas-enarbolan-las-megaobras-de-morales-y-la-traicion-de-arce-para-promocionar-la-candidatura-de-evo-2025-](https://brujuladigital.net/politica/evistas-enarbolan-las-megaobras-de-morales-y-la-traicion-de-arce-para-promocionar-la-candidatura-de-evo-2025-) \n\nWhere are the popcorn and pasancallas?",

    "selftext": "Has anyone else noticed an increase in fake sales with online retailers? I mainly do my shopping online nowadays and I've been aware of them on Amazon for a bit now, but not seeing anything about them posted anywhere from a quick google search I decided I should start the discussion on it.\n\nI'll post some examples for you here in case you aren't aware.\n\nHere is my first [example](http://www.ncix.com/detail/seagate-st4000dx001-sshd-4tb-3-5in-64-91259-1146.htm) (Here is a [screenshot](http://puu.sh/jJAlv/52248253d8.jpg) of it since it's a daily deal). The price is listed at $179.99 with the regular price at $239.98. Seems like a good deal of course, but if you look at another website that tracks prices you'll see that the price has [never reached the regular price](http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/seagate-internal-hard-drive-st4000dx001).\n\nHere is another [example](http://www.amazon.ca/Bosch-DDB181-02-Lithium-Ion-Batteries-Contractor/dp/B00N8I29X2/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1440184637&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=cordless+drill). 74% off the regular price eh? Sounds a fucking steal and you'd be stupid to pass it up. Well on another website that also tracks prices you can see that it has [never been even close to the regular price](http://ca.camelcamelcamel.com/Bosch-DDB181-02-Lithium-Ion-Batteries-Contractor/product/B00N8I29X2). And yes I know Amazon doesn't control the prices of third-party retailers, but this one is sold by Amazon. \n\nThe Competition Bureau of Canada forbids this. The rules are similar to the US rules where you have to have had the product at the regular price for a significant amount of time or you have to have sold a substantial volume of the product at the regular price before you can call anything else a \"sale price\". There is a good write-up [here](http://option-consommateurs.org/documents/principal/en/File/rapports/commercial_practices/oc_ic07_soldes_20110921_eng.pdf) from consommateurs.org. The relevant law information starts on page 32 of the PDF (or page 22 of the report) or [directly here](http://www.laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-34/page-43.html#h-24) from government website.\n\nI'm going to be making a complaint [here](http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/h_00019.html) myself. It's a little misleading but they have an online form for you to fill out. I'm only recently becoming more conscious so I'm wondering myself how many times I've fallen for it.\n\nNow lets the discussion started. Have you noticed it yourself? Have you been a victim? Have you tried filing a complaint with the retailer or competition bureau? If so did how did it work out for you?",

    "selftext": "Good day, fellow Namibians.  \nI understand that a lot of us aren't so happy about the Namibian media situation, right now, and State-owned ones, in particular. However, New Era was actually quite a reasonable source, when it came to our natural resources. Sure, an op-ed (formerly called a Letter to the Editors) does (should) neither represent the tendencies of the editorial, nor does it need to be up to common journalistic standards. But what is this?\n\nI can see someone already called out the constitutional aspects on FB, but how come those \"decolonising\" narratives are that common in Namibia, even among oKwaludi law students? Mining and its revenue streams aren't \"colonised\". Namibia's largest GDP inflow is via diamonds (including their fashioning and trade, amounting to a staggering 6.5% of Namibian GDP, back in 2023 (Namibian Mines last reporting date). The Namibian state is in a 50:50 joint venture and still raises 55% diamond tax, plus royalties and export levies.\n\nLithium? Why should Namibia take that detour? Worldwide refining is 99% in the PR of China and who are we to stand up to this?\n\nGold: Some Namibians forget that Namibia actually imports (mostly) Bulgarian copper ore to produce refined copper, silver and gold, domestically. It's called the Tsumeb smelter. Yes, it's being run by a Chinese company, now, but what do we expect? It was on the stock markets, for anyone to take a share. And decide.\n\n[https://neweralive.na/opinion-decolonising-namibias-mining-industry/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJaGTBleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHWkETWEfdUpzjXki1T2ZPkEhHOARl\\_wFJzRBfkisx2mAm2fugvbtY2vJDQ\\_aem\\_YxT1SiQCuTxi9EoIhyQw4g](https://neweralive.na/opinion-decolonising-namibias-mining-industry/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJaGTBleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHWkETWEfdUpzjXki1T2ZPkEhHOARl_wFJzRBfkisx2mAm2fugvbtY2vJDQ_aem_YxT1SiQCuTxi9EoIhyQw4g)",

    "selftext": "I am bipolar 2 and I want to take better care of myself, but treatment is still somewhat confusing. The pair I most commonly see is lithium + lamotrigine or lithium + quetiapine. This combination is the one recommended by official guidelines but... I'm hesitant to try them. The first one because I'm sensitive to mania. Without being triggered, especially by mania-inducing drugs, I may even appear unipolar depressed, but mania is there, creeping in, waiting for the trigger and lamotrigine is uplifting. I've read many posts of people saying they felt suicidal, enraged or even manic while taking it. As quetiapine goes, I feel it's too strong for my case but a bipolar doesn't have a lot of options medication wise, so I don't know what else I could use. Appreciate any help. ",

I’m also on Lamictal 100mg and Wellbutrin XL 150mg, which I tolerate well, but I’ve still struggled with mood swings, motivation, and feeling like myself.\n\nI can’t tolerate weight gain. It’s not just about vanity—it messes with my self-esteem, my drive, and my ability to show up in the world the way I want to. Depression has already stolen so much time from me. I’m exhausted from trial and error, but I’m not giving up on myself.\n\nI took my first dose of Lithium ER tonight, and… I’m scared. Somehow I feel a little peaceful…. Lol \n\t•\tScared of feeling numb\n\t•\tScared of side effects\n\t•\tScared of not recognizing myself again\n\t•\tBut also… hopeful. I want real stability—not just being okay for a week, but being okay consistently. I want to be emotionally available to the people I love. I want to focus, create, move my body, and build something that feels like a life.\n\nSo if you’ve started Lithium—especially the ER version—what was your Day 1 like?\nDid you feel anything right away? Any tips for hydration, nausea, or adjusting? What should I look forward too?\n\nI’d really appreciate any insight or support.

    "selftext": "Hello, dear Redditors,\nSearching for some experience with lithium given to kids.\nOfficially my 8 y.o. was diagnosed with ADHD with main feature being very poor impulse control. Most troubles we get from his impulsive aggression when he is not even angry but rather excited. He throws things at us, he pushes other children, he physically fights with us, cannot stand frustration, etc. It was a nightmare.His psych tried Strattera, Abilify, Risperdal, then Valproic acid, at some point there were four medicines together - abilify, risperidone, valproic acid and later lithium. When he was first started on lithium, he was taking valproic acid, abilify and risperidone as well. We have only available lithium in 300mg pills which cannot be divided. So we had to start him on 300 mg and after about a week increased to 600mg. After 10 days on 600 he had mild intoxication so we had to stop lithium, though the behaviour was much much better. Then we tried Trileptal but that didnt work. I managed to get for him another lithium preparation - Hypnorex retard - which comes in 400-mg pills and can be divided in two.  While we were waiting for it to come doctor started him again on that 300 mg pill because the behaviour was awful. This time the only add-on med we had was risperidone. Physical being was fine, lithium level was low and we didnt increase. The behaviour was bad. Then Hypnorex came and we switched from 300 mg pill IR to 400 mg Hypnorex Retard. Everything was fine, the behaviour started to improve a bit. Today I got his level results and it was 0,5 (the test was taken 4 days ago). Also, four days ago we increased his lithium to 600 mg hypnorex retard. And now, on the fourth day after increase, his headache was coming on and off during the day and by night he felt slight nausea and was pale and weak, went off to sleep.\nIm really worried if that might be a sign he is going to get intoxicated again(\nPlease, share your experiences, if your child was ever put on lithium and you were increasing, did they have side effects like these which later subsided?\nThank you so much in advance!\n",

Now its two weeks since he's been put on 600 mg. I wonder, if that is a normal course of lithium to gradually improve with occasional relapses or should the improvement be smooth?\nI asked the doc, he several time kinda ignored or didnt pay attention to this question. In the end he said that dynamics is very good and later it will be better. He also mentioned they unlikely we would be able to increase further because now the level taken on the 7th day after starting 600 is 0,71 and further increase might be not safe. \nThanks everyone who shares!",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone!\nMy kid is 8 years old, on lithium.\nI know the majority of lithium users here are adults but that shouldnt differ much between adult and child.\nPlease, share your experience, or maybe somebody already asked the doc about such situations.\n\nIf you get intoxicated after eating food which was not fresh, or, for example, after accidentally eating some bacteria with food, and you start vomiting heavily. What would you do to refill the fluids? Where we live if you call with these symptoms to emergency, they may ride to you during 40 mins, then they will take you to a bacterial hospital, because noone else will take you, this will take other 40 mins or so, then wait until being registered, etc etc, so until the kid can get IV fluids with electrolites very much time will pass.\n\nAnother question concerns falling ill with fever. Do you reduce fever more often compared to when you are not on lithium? \n\nIve been asking our doc about it but he obviously thinks these questions are not as important and doesnt reply...\n\nThank you all!",

No problems.\nAll was fine until my primary care doctor introduced a new blood pressure med and then doubled the dosage. \nI had no idea what was going on with me. I had a tremor, nausea, vomiting and dizziness. My psychiatrist noticed my symptoms in session and got a lithium level. It was 1.5. He had me stop lithium completely for a day and now I’m on 900 mg a day. I know this is not a therapeutic dose for me but I know he has to get things under control. The blood pressure med had increased my lithium level.\nI’m just scared of what is going to happen. Will my mood tank? Will I fall into mania? I know what I was like before I was stable and I will lose everything I have worked so hard for if I fall into this disease now. \nHas anybody been through this?

I can't be a support to my partner and now that I'm living alone, I'm not even taking care of basic needs like eating or bathing. Sorry for the honesty. I was thinking of taking immediate release lithium because I'm so scared of trying medications and I was intending to cut the tablet on half (150mg) but doctor prescribed ER, meaning I won't be able to reduce the dose. Feeling medicated can make me anxious, so I wonder if 450mg ER would feel as too much, especially since I'd be taking all that dose on the first day. Also worried about brain fog and too much emotional blunting. It's my first time taking this medication and the only other I'm taking is propranolol. \n\nQ2: Is it safe to go one month without testing? \n\nI had consulted a psych a year ago and she mentioned about weekly blood tests for lithium. I didn't take it then. I consulted with another psych today and she didn't mention I should do a blood test every week. Just told me to take it and come back after a month. \n\nI'm taking lithium for bipolar. To manage the highs and lows. Due to bipolar, was told ssris weren't indicated (also my experience) and depakene gave me tremors, so now trying lithium. \n\n\n\n",

It's something we have to cope with for as long as we are taking lithium? And vomiting? Is it a normal side effect even in safe blood levels? I'm scared of meds, so I want to know what is normal and what isn't. \n\nLastly, someone here said that withdrawal from lithium is brutal. Especially abrupt discontinuation. That anger to a very high degree can be experienced and they might do something rash if something triggers them in that period. It was my understanding that lithium withdrawal was milder in comparison to antidepressants and antipsychotics, so this is another thing I'm worried about. Sometimes I think I shouldn't be on any medication. I'm so broken inside. The panic, the anger, the SI so elevated that taking or going off might trigger something really bad, maybe mortally bad. I guess I am looking for reassurance but also honesty. If it can be bad for me, I'd like to know before starting. \n\n",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been struggling with severe depressive symptoms for over two years now. Besides emotional pain and anxiety, my biggest issues are constant physical sensations: intense inner tension, a crushing pressure (especially in my belly and chest), and a burning sensation that never really goes away. It feels like my nervous system is stuck in permanent fight-or-flight mode — I can never fully relax, even though I can usually fall asleep.\n\nSo far, medications like Duloxetine, Pregabalin, and Mirtazapine haven’t really helped with these symptoms. I’ve recently learned that what I’m experiencing might be described as agitated depression, somatic symptoms, or psychomotor agitation.\n\nSoon, I’ll be starting Lithium, and I’m cautiously hopeful it could make a difference — maybe by calming my nervous system and addressing these physical aspects of my depression.\n\nIf you've been treated with Lithium, did it help with symptoms like inner tension, pressure, burning sensations, and overall physical restlessness?\nI would really appreciate hearing your experiences.\n\nThank you so much!",

I'm pretty sure it's the lithium doing it since it changes how your kidneys handle water. I brought it up to my psychiatrist and he lowered the dose from 600mg a day to 450mg a day. 600mg is already a small dose and even on that dose my bloodwork showed that my lithium was low.\n\nWith the lower dose I immediately started noticing bad changes, deeper depression, not getting work done, bad thoughts. The doctor said that if that sort of thing happened to increase the dose back to what is was, so I am. I'm just going to do what he says. I don't even know what to do. At this point I don't even know if the lithium is what is causing that. I can't function without this med.\n\nHonestly I hate that I have to take 5 medications to even keep myself normal enough to function. Why must one of the ones that really works be so harsh?",

    "selftext": "I went to an ENT today to have a checkup. I’m a singer and song writer and have always wanted to be professional. I used to have a very good voice. Ever since the first week I started Lithium, I have been having weird things happen to my voice and vocal abilities. \n\nFast forward to eight months later, and now I can barely sing. It affects my speaking voice, singing voice, and laugh. When I sing it affects my range, control, pitch, smoothness of transitions, vibrato, style/phrasing, tone, and overall sound. I am often short of breath when I am not even singing (oxygen hunger). \n\nThe ENT said that there is nothing visibly wrong. He prescribed me medication for acid reflux (which I have symptoms of) and referred me to a voice specialist to see if they might pick up on more subtle clues. \n\nI am forced to take Lithium under a court order, and the Doctor tried me on a different medication but it did not work out. For most of my treatment, she has not believed me about the effects of Lithium on my voice and all together disregarded it. However, the Doctor in the psyche ward who initially prescribed Lithium said that some of the medications can affect the voice. But she didn’t care and prescribed it to me anyway. \n\nFrom my research on the internet, I know that Lithium can cause partial vocal cord paralysis and full paralysis. With partial paralysis, one can have a completely normal speaking voice but still have the paralysis. Honestly, I still wonder if this is what I might have despite what the ENT said. My throat/vocal cords feel stiff and rigid and they refuse to move the way that they once did. Everything is placed differently now, and it is more nasal. \n\nFrom the moment I started the Lithium my speaking voice sounded different and I asked my mother how I sounded and she said, “different”. \n\nI am so sick of being unintentionally “gaslighted” by people who say that I sound fine or that there is nothing wrong with me. It is beginning to hurt my spirit. So many non-singers will tell me that the voice needs exercise and practice much like an athlete would need which is just not true. When you have a natural talent, you don’t suddenly sound drastically different just because you are “rusty”. I never needed to warm up or practice before. There is a difference between sounding a little rusty and having full on atrophy/dysfunction. \n\nI went from sounding like an all star singer to sounding like an amateur. How such a gift could be mistreated is beyond me. This all could’ve been avoided but my psychiatrist remained stuck in her ways. Now I wonder if I will ever fully recover. \n\nAnyone else have vocal issues on Lithium?\n\n***Edit/Update: I saw the Voice Specialist. I was diagnosed with vocal cord atrophy on one side, and paresis. The folds won’t close together properly so I have to strain, even when talking. I have to do 3 months of voice therapy and hope for the best.",

I forgot.\n\n* (me) lil over 30 I guess. \\[that was around my age\\]\n\n* Umm, did any1 ever speak to u abt being bipolar?\n\n* (me) Ye, plenty, but theyre never acting on anything and I dont rly wanna talk about everything.\n* U know what, I think we should try lithium for u.\n\n\n\nSo here we are. Ive been on lithium since then and got my bp diagnosis not long after, and tbh, Ive never been this stable on any drug. Pre L, once my brain started getting fked up, I always thought Id end up taking my life. But this drug made me feel like I could actually have a chance u know.\n\n\n\nIn less than a year my side effects were:\n\nWeight gain -> +23 kg\n\nLoss in IQ (trust me) -> -30p at least xD\n\nAcne -> my body is shooting out sebum. And yet, Im dry as a mf regarding hair, skin, lips, mouth. How does the body even come up with this??\n\nPolyury, or like I wrote, w/e its called -> I drink 9 liters of water/day and pee all the time.\n\nHand tremor -> Sometimes I cant drink without using both hands and I usually spill (its not even sexy commercial style)\n\n\n\nand these ones arent even the worst. The worst is: DIARRHEAAA, or as this guy on this forum \\[bless u man!!!\\] is writing “Ive got the shits”. I have a really hard time working or having a social life with this. Being or feeling like Im fat and ugly, thats secondary, but I really need help with this.\n\n\n\nSo I change the formula from “Lithionit 42mg (6mmol)” \\[Lithium Sulphate\\] to “Litiumkarbonat OBA 300 mg (8,1 mmol Li+)” \\[Lithium Carbonate\\] and yet its not good enough.\n\nOther things I tried is changing my diet (IBS-diet), worked pre L but not anymore. Now trying IGT for half a year, nobody is asking me if Im pregnant anymore, but the diarrhea is not gone.\n\nAround a week ago I changed coffee for matcha. I try to drink less alcohol but it doesnt help either.\n\nNow Ive lost it completely, and I’m gonna try something called calamus root, TBD. Clearly I need help.\n\nPlease help me.\n\n",

She claimed it was because she was .84 on the paper and that to her was fine. I told her that was inadequate as we're dealing with more than numbers here, and that my experience with psychiatrists upon starting new medications involve routine follow up during the initial months of treatment.\n\nI'm really unsure what to do because I worry my dad is masking how well he is. It's difficult to present any collateral to the psychiatrist when I am right beside him in the room and I feel bad saying things like \"he doesn't leave his house\" or \"it doesn't seem he has showered or washed his clothes in 6 months\". I've never seen him so sedentary and I'm worried if he doesn't get moving again his body is just going to shut down on him.\n\nIt's been about a month since he's been on 900mg and there has been little change in his mood and virtually no increase in his motivation. I have noticed he is eating way more sugar than before and wonder if that's his escape from feeling anhedonic?\n\nI tried to tell him i need him to pick up his own prescription (it's about a 10 min walk away from him), as I'm struggling to keep up with my work and his care. I see him twice a week for groceries, a meal and any appointments and I just don't know how I can keep this up. \n\n\n",

    "selftext": "I have muscle tightness all my life. No doctor ever saw a problem but it's a big problem.\n\nThere are so many names for tight muscles.\nMyotonia \nTaut muscle bands\nMuscle rigidity\nInflexible muscles \nPermanently contracted muscles\nThe list goes on and on...\n\nBut one thing I've noticed is, although lithium is studied sparsely compared to other minerals such as magnesium and potassium, one thing seems to be understood clearly:\n\nLithium prevents the excessive buildup of calcium in the cytoplasm of the cell.\n\nExcessive calcium in the cytoplasm leads to over-activation.\n\nOver-activation can take the form of neurotoxicity in the brain. This excitatory neurotoxicity in the brain can manifest as mania or possibly as other mood instabilities, such as anxiety. Bipolar people have very high amounts of calcium in the cytoplasm of their brain cells, and lithium lowers this calcium through a complicated route. The lowered calcium in the cytoplasm is highly correlated with bipolar symptom relief. The overstimulation ceases when you lower the calcium in the cytoplasm.\n\n\nI wonder what over-activation would look like in the muscle cells?\n\nMuscles that are permanently contracted, if my theory is correct. This has been my lifelong experience.\n\nIt is notable that any mineral not in the goldilocks zone will create issues. I see many people on this board complaining about tight muscles and aching/popping joints from lithium. Lithium doses normally given by doctor's to treat bipolar condition.\n\nWhat if excessive or deficient lithium is one of the things that causes muscles to never fully relax? What if taking too much, or getting too little, is why muscles cannot relax? What if muscle cells and brain cells have similar excitability, but manifest themselves differently as either mental or physical symptoms?\n\nIf this is true, you would be able to solve not only the mental anguish of lithium deficiency, but also the physical pain.\n\nI'm curious if this fits with your lived experience and I'd love to hear from you in the comment below!\n\nI currently have a brilliant biochemistry PhD/MD/nutritionist friend looking for the best neuromuscular neurologist we can find for my treatment.\n\nMany of us don't know where to start with these symptoms and I think we can work together to find the best telemedicine possible.\n\nI will post studies and updates to my research if there is sufficient interest in solving this case.",

I currently take 300mg 3x/day. I am also taking a drug called vraylar. \nBefore my suicide attempt I was a writer. I stopped writing for a long time after the attempt because I was struggling just with day to day stuff. Recently I've tried to start writing again, though, and I can't do it. I can't get into a flow, it feels difficult and confusing, and everything I write is absolute garbage. I compare it to the stuff I wrote before everything happened and it's like night and day. Nothing I write now has any chance of getting published. \nI find it ironic that the lithium is supposed to help with being suicidal, but instead it's taken away the only reason I had to live. \nHas anyone heard of this happening before? If I go off of the lithium will my talents come back, or are they gone forever? I'm scared I have permanent brain damage from this drug. Or maybe it's the vraylar, I don't know. All I know is that something is wrong, and I won't survive very long like this. \nI've brought up my concerns with my doctor and she doesn't seem to take me seriously. That, or she thinks the problems will go away. \nAny advice would be very much appreciated. I'm scared and I don't know what to do.",

For reference I am quite thin, I’ve been vegan for 10 years, no alcohol and low sodium diet. \n\nIn March of this year I went on a 5 day spring ski trip which involved heavy exercise all day, hot tub all night, very little water drinking, and I got SO sick. I had severe GI issues, I’m talking like nothing I’ve ever had with food poisoning. And I know it wasn’t food poisoning, at that point I would regularly throw up in the morning after taking my meds and always had a specific taste in my mouth that I thought was the lithium. \n\nI didn’t think to get tested until several days after I got back and rehydrated, and my results were in range, but also I couldn’t keep my meds down so I assume my levels would have rapidly dropped? \n\nI’ve gone down to 750mg and last tested at 0.91. I don’t have GI side effects anymore but I am concerned about my thyroid and kidney tests. My eGFR is 79 which doesn’t seem right given my lifestyle factors and age. \n\nMy doctors seem adamant that 18 months on lithium is not enough to affect my organs.

I have tried adjunctive antipsychotics throughout my treatment but other than Amisulpride/Solian, pretty much none of them I have tried so far have had any considerable benefit enough to continue long term.\n\nBasically, anything I should consider or look out for if/when I start lithium?. I understand people have different tolerabilities and reactions to it; and side effects can sometimes be unpleasant. I am hoping I will respond effectively without too many SEs at a lower end of a “therapeutic” dose.\n\nThank you for any experiences/advice  ",

I guess i built a tolerance because i felt like they weren't doing anything for me anymore. \n\nSo i stopped taking all of them cold turkey. Bad idea. Got incredibly INCREDIBLY depressed, so my psych put me on lithium. \n\nFirst of all, he told me it wouldn't cause weight gain. I knew that was a lie bc i had a friend that took it and she got super heavy on it, and i also googled it and google says that patients typically will gain between 10 to 26 pounds on it. Anyone experience weight gain or better yet NOT experience weight gain? Let me know. \n\nSecondly, yesterday i drank less than 4 white claws. I was totally fine until out of nowhere everything started spinning and i started puking a bunch. I usually have a high tolerance towards alcohol, so I'm assuming the lithium is to blame for that. How has lithium + alcohol interacted for yall? Is lithium one of those meds i just shouldn't drink on? I never had this problem with the other 3 meds, i could drink on them pretty fine, so i was very bewildered when i got that messed up yesterday off less than 4 white claws (which have a low alcohol content)\n\nAdditionally, i told my friend i started taking it and she said \"please be careful. My friend was on that and then stopped taking it and wound up in a mental institution.\" So that was alarming. I'm usually pretty bad at taking my meds on time & consistently, so should i be concerned? If i don't succeed in taking this every time im supposed to, is it going to really damage my mental health??\n\nThen i told my sister i started taking it. Her response was \"oh god. Please be careful. That's the crap they put Brittney spears on and she went nuts.\"\n\nSo I'm getting a lot of alarming responses from people when i tell them i just started taking it. For those of you that have been on it for awhile, should i be worried? What is there for me to know about this medication? What should i expect? Thank you. ",

I was diagnosed with atrophy of one vocal cord and vocal paresis. The two folds at the top won’t close together properly and have to strain, even when I am talking. I have to do three months of voice therapy then return to the Doctor for a follow up. I am a singer so this is really upsetting for me. The specialist says that I should be able to sing the way I used to after completing therapy, so that is good news, but he thinks I should go to a neurologist for the Parkinsonian symptoms I am having (and by the way this is one of them!). Maybe now the psychiatrist who is force drugging me will listen to me! Immediately after taking Lithium, I began having voice changes and this is how they have escalated.

    "selftext": "I'm 62 and I've been on Lithium for about 8 years since being diagnosed with Bipolar.  Due to Kidney issues and a tremor I'm slowly being switched to Lamotrigine.  I was taking 900 mg a day and the doc is titrating me down 300 mg a month and ramping up the Lamotrigine from 50 to 100.  I'm pretty sure he'll stop the Lithium completely at our next appointment next week and increase the Lamotrigine to 150 mg.\n\nIt hasn't been fantastic but it I've been able to deal with it.  When talking to the doctor about this he explained that Lithium slows down brain function and when it's reduced it will have the opposite effects.\n\nSome of the issues I've been having are; worse sleep.  \n\n1. My sleep has never been great.  Prior to reducing the lithium I would usually wake up at 2 or 3 and stay about for about 1.5 hours and then go back to sleep.  Now it's getting up twice a night and then waking around 5 or 5:30.\n2. My thoughts are moving more quickly and I am making more decisions.  It might be clarity, I don't think it's mania.\n3. I've been more irritable and quick to losing my temper.  I think that's not as bad as it was 3 weeks ago when I reduced the Lithium from 600 to 300 mg.\n\nAn FYI - Prior to starting Lithium I had periodic depressions running from bad to worse over many years.  Then I had a manic episode and a deep depression that followed and that's when I was put on Lithium\n\nI was hoping people might let me know if they had any of the same or a different experience than me.\n\nThank you!

I don't know. I do know that getting back on lithium (for me at least) means several weeks of bad side effects. In general I just wish there was more known about the interactions and risks between these substances...",

Never had any thyroid issues in my life: maybe until now.\n\nMost recent lab panel 09/23 due to insurance issues. Then yesterday. \n\nI had my Lithium level tested yesterday: 0.8. Highest ever. TSH: 6.290. Normal range is 0.45-4.5. I’ve never been out of normal range. Then CMP, mostly all within normal range.\n\nI’ve read that Lithium can cause thyroid issues. Is there anything that I can do to help it with Lithium (outside of a thyroid pill)? Drink more water, etc? I’ve never had thyroid issues before and would really like to get rid of that.\n\nIs there a possibility it’s a fluke and need retesting? Or time of day, issue that I hadn’t had water or food when I tested, etc?\n\nIf you’ve been in similar situation, what did you do? Does Lithium need to be discontinued/decreased in some circumstances? Can the thyroid issues be reversed?\n\nLithium has been the biggest life saver for me, but the last few months I’ve been struggling.\n\nI meet with my psych next week, so I am looking for experiences, not medical advice.\n\nThanks for any thoughts and insights, everyone.",

I started lithium 3 weeks ago, go diagnosed with bipolar type 2 at the same time, and since 1 weeks every time i take my lithium (600 mg) i feel extremely nauseous its unbearable... because of it its hard to eat because of the metallic taste and my apetite is very low. This week i forgot to take it before bed, so i took it the next morning and OMG i felt so sick i tried to vomit but it didn't work and i was K.O. all day. I decided to stop i cant manage the side-effect. Can i stop taking it? \n\nUPDATE: thanks everyone for your much needed help i decided to take only 300mg and it worked really well with no side effect so with time we'll see if its enough.

I had my lithium level done yesterday and it was middle to lower meaning there is still room for increasing it but given the sadness and migraine and nausea I don’t know if I should continue with the doctor and this medication. Are there any positives?\n\n I would appreciate anyone answering, your kindness is noticed. ",

I've tried to explain to the doctors it's the anxiety and ocd that causes my low mood and they started me on lithium a few months ago. My blood has never been in the therapeutic level. I just said I wanted to come off it all, including the fluoxetine which I have been off almost 3 weeks. \n\nI'm just worried about what happens now. How long does lithium carbonate take to fully leave your system etc and am I likely to get a massive dump of withdrawals? I use diazepam to keep the panic at bay. \n\nAny suggestions, experiences or advice would be great! \n\nThanks 😀",

Why would they partner so closely on a project with LAC and fund it to the tune of 625 million dollars and then sell half of their investment position on that project?? Just to diversify? They put that money and an additional $8 million into LAAC but still. They’re literally partnered on the project they had 625 million dollars on and chose to diversify into other lithium projects in a different continent. Is this a bearish sign? What is this going to do to the stock price short term of LAC if 15,000,000+ shares are now on the market waiting to be bought? ",

    "title": "Analysis of the News Announcement: \"LITHIUM AMERICAS ANNOUNCES INTENTION TO SEPARATE INTO TWO LEADING LITHIUM COMPANIES\" (11/3/22)",
    "selftext": "Lithium Americas announced this morning the separation of the North American and South American assets in order to \"unlock\" value:\n\n[www.lithiumamericas.com/news/lithium-americas-announces-intention-to-separate-into-two-leading-lithium-companies](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/news/lithium-americas-announces-intention-to-separate-into-two-leading-lithium-companies)\n\nI received several questions on this, and I will speak to my own experiences on spin-offs to the most frequently asked questions (note: I CAN BE WRONG in anything I say below, so make sure do your own research/due diligence):\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Why is LAC doing this?**\n\nThere are numerous possible reasons:\n\n1. A separation would permit each company to focus its leadership on its own unique strategic business plan based on their geography, financing, cash flows, legal situation and resource type\n2. It would allow each company flexibility to allocate resources and raise/deploy capital in a manner consistent with its own business strategy\n3. It would also allow each company to focus on streamlining each distinct operation based on its resource type – brine in Argentina, and clay/sedimentary in Nevada, USA\n4. Two separate companies have the potential to provide investors with greater value than a single combined company (see Mckinsey study further below)\n5. Investors (institutional and retail) may have a preference or restriction on or against any of the following: **A.** One geography (e.g., Nevada vs. Argentina) or another but not both or **B.** A positive cash flow producing miner (e.g., CO) vs. a development stage miner (e.g., TP) and **C**. A litigation pending (e.g., TP and the associated risk/stigmas with it) vs a \"free to produce\" near-production asset (e.g., CO).  By separating the entities, LAC is creating value by creating desirable investment opportunities to a broader investor base.\n6. There is an \"unlocking value\" premium for the Nevada Mining Unit due to its location in one of the world’s premier mining jurisdictions vs. Argentina  (THIS IS BY FAR THE BIGGEST REASON IN OUR OPINION - see further below for more explanation)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Other Articles describing Spinoffs Specifically that you may find helpful**\n\nFINRA:\n\n[www.finra.org/investors/insights/splitting-difference-four-reasons-why-corporations-pursue-spinoffs](https://www.finra.org/investors/insights/splitting-difference-four-reasons-why-corporations-pursue-spinoffs)\n\nHarvard Law has a good descriptive chart (see below):\n\n[corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2019/10/31/spin-offs-unraveled/](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2019/10/31/spin-offs-unraveled/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mx8beoqcqsx91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=67f2a1aa430646d57c8ccfa52bab7479b456b55b\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **If there is a Spinoff/IPO with no capital raise will there be a S-1 registration?**\n\nNot likely.\n\nIf it is done on a US exchange (as with LAC), there may likely be filed a Form 10 Registration Statement which will serve in its place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **If it is a Spinoff, Will management provide guidance prior to a Spinoff on the two separate entities?**\n\nFrom the Harvard article, in most spin-off transactions, NewCo management often waits until NewCo’s first quarterly earnings call post-closing of the transaction before providing annual guidance. This timing allows NewCo management to review its guidance policy and actual guidance figures with NewCo’s board of directors, which will be newly-constituted at closing of the transaction.\n\nAs an alternative, some NewCos choose to publish their forecasted guidance figures immediately prior to the closing of the transaction so that they can discuss the guidance with investors during non-deal roadshows. These non-deal roadshows are typically held a couple of weeks prior to the closing and during the “when-issued” trading period (discussed below).\n\nIt is common practice for companies (e.g., LAC and NewCo) to file the investor deck to be used at such non-deal roadshows on a Current Report on Form 8-K to satisfy Regulation FD requirements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What does \"Unlocking Value\" mean?**\n\nThe premise of this \"breakup\"/Separation is to enable each operation to trade in-line with its respective peer group's trading multiples associated with their respective mining jurisdictions (i.e., Argentina vs Nevada).\n\nOften times, when you have two resources in the mining world in two very different jurisdictions, there is a different level of perceived risk and value for both as a result of a variety of factors (e.g., Taxes at the Federal/State/Local levels, Political Risk, Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Inflation/Costs, Regulatory, Permitting, Infrastructure, ESG, etc.).\n\nThe Fraser Institute puts out an annual survey that provides a good understanding of these jurisdictions and relative scorings and rankings:\n\n[www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/annual-survey-of-mining-companies-2021.pdf](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/annual-survey-of-mining-companies-2021.pdf)\n\nIn the report, you will see Argentina (as part of Latin America) is ranked in the lower half of jurisdictions with \"Jujuy\" (where Cauchari-Olaroz is located) being scored at \"61.17\" and ranked 44th out of 84 jurisdictions:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qy20x2kkqqx91.png?width=731&format=png&auto=webp&s=79184a5c5dc192f5f57b2fe7f2bd5b43cc7430e1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3au2lgqoqqx91.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=972713b71b75ef12225a6e8348104b3ab5b98234\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tkl79bsvqqx91.png?width=711&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc14eaeee68dd2ac348ecc173571df1a6c670568\n\nIn contrast, Nevada (as shown below) is ranked very highly with a score of \"91.77\" and ranked #6 out of 84 jurisdictions:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6fgljfqnrqx91.png?width=648&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b585d96ff11cf4e265cf1fad6f605fa0c98f0f1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mdlc7jr6rqx91.png?width=719&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c24cb4946a22480de4f8173024843039db6da7c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn theory, valuations based on trading multiples for a Nevada mining unit would trade at a premium relative to Argentina valuation multiples (when comparing similar cash flow structures).\n\nCurrently, shares for LAC (at \\~$25/share) are trading at the floor value of just the Cauchari-Olaroz mining unit alone and placing no value on the North American or Pastos Grandes/Arena Minerals unit.  This is in line with a couple of analysts commentary.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **How long does it take for the Stock to typically unlock the value?**\n\nFrom the Harvard article:\n\n\" As a result of SpinCo’s inability to provide research analysts with long-term projections and the typical timeframe in which SpinCo provides annual guidance to the Street, it often takes two to three quarters post-closing for SpinCo’s stock to trade at a multiple that represents fully-distributed value. \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Will Existing Management manage both Entities?**\n\nPer the press release, it is likely there will be two separate independent management teams.\n\nAlready, both North America and South America operate as separate business units and the transition in management should not be disruptive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Will the headquarters move from Canada to the United States?**\n\nLithium Americas is located in Vancouver, BC, Canada:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/prjd5ykvtqx91.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=28522c1d3de20e954495664720675e07db97b7b2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is located in the \"capital of world mining\":\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1bvwl609tqx91.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=a247bcbbd8e609cedba9ab9c6f18e2dddf39179e\n\nAs a result, it does not make sense or benefit LAC's current team to relocate to the United States as there is no additional benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act (which accepts Canada as a Free-trade partner) or requirement by the DOE ATVM loan facility for a company to be headquartered in the US to be able to participate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **How many shares of each entity will I get?  Will it be one for one?**\n\nThe number of shares for each entity will be determined by management, but your percentage ownership in each entity will remain approximately the same as it was before the spinoff relative to the other common shareholders.\n\nPer the press release, if it is a spinoff, one entity (e.g., South America) will assume the title of Lithium International and your share count in that entity will not change.\n\nThe NewCo share count (i.e., North America) will be determined by LAC prior to the spin-off.\n\nFor example, for every current share of Lithium International (e.g., South America) you will receive \"Y\" number of shares in NewCo (i.e., North America) where X can be a fraction or a whole number greater than, equal to, or less than one.\n\nThe choice of the number of shares in NewCo will be based on what they believe is necessary to meet Exchange requirements as well as maintain a health stock price (e.g., to avoid being valued as a \"penny stock\", meet minimum price requirements, share count requrements, etc..).\n\nBelow are listing requirements for the NYSE (which hopefully the NewCo will list on since LAC is currently listed there):\n\n[www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/listing/NYSE\\_Initial\\_Listing\\_Standards\\_Summary.pdf](https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/listing/NYSE_Initial_Listing_Standards_Summary.pdf)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tahb0ata9rx91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a6568056c640dbc0ce2b5eae26a3880d02387d7\n\nIt is a popular misconception to think that you will get 1 share of each entity for each share of LAC you currently own (that is a low probability scenario given historical precedent).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **How will the Market value NewCo?   Will there be a valuation on NewCo by LAC?**\n\nManagement will likely have an internal valuation done  (by Management and/or Third Party Advisors such as BMO or an independent third party).\n\nThey may not (or less likely May) publicly share those valuations.\n\nUltimately, the market will be informed about what assets and liabilities are retained in each entity through the filings and, after the date of separation, the two entities' market caps will be dictated by the free markets at that point.\n\nThere will likely be a deterioration in one of entity's shares (e.g., LAC) but that loss should more than be offset by the additional shares in NewCo based on my own experiences.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Will the trading on NewCo commence immediately?**\n\nIn my experience, there can be a delay on the trading of the NewCo shares post the date of separation (e.g., \"Fortitude Gold\" or \"Premier Gold\").  While not desirable, we should be aware that it is possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **If it is a Spinoff, what are some key steps/milestones?**\n\nThis is a sample sequential milestones:\n\n## Public Filing of Form 10 (Flip to Public)\n\nDeclaration Date\n\nForm 10 Effective Date\n\nStart of When-Issued Trading on Exchange\n\nRecord Date\n\nDistribution Date (Separation Occurs)\n\nStart of Regular-Way Trading on an Exchange\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **How is the cost basis determined?**\n\nFrom my experience, the cost basis allocation between the two new share types will be determined by management and their advisors who will provide that information to the brokerage firms.  Your new cost basis will likely be split proportionate to that (talk to your accountant/advisors to confirm).\n\nIt's important to be aware that the cost basis allocated between companies may not match with the proportionate share counts received (e.g., if you end up with 1000 LAC shares and 500 NewCo shares does NOT mean you will have 2/3rds of your cost basis in the 1000 LAC shares and 1/3rd of the cost basis in the 500 shares of NewCo).  That allocation, again, is determined and provided by LAC.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Will I be taxed by this NewCo/Spinoff?**\n\nAs the press release states, \" Lithium Americas (NewCo) will occur on a tax-deferred basis for the purposes of the *Income Tax Act (Canada)*. The Company also intends for the Separation to occur on a tax-deferred basis for shareholders resident in the U.S. for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **I own call options in LAC today, what will my new strike price be and what will I receive?**\n\nFrom my experience, the strike price should remain the same.\n\nEach call option that expires after the planned date for the separation, will \"likely\" reflect 100 LAC shares and \"Y\" x 100 NewCo shares (where \"Y\" is a fraction or multiplier of an LAC share that is determined by LAC will issued for each LAC share - see above comments on \"Y\").\n\nTo clarify, this is based on my two experiences in the past (e.g., Fortitude Gold).\n\nEach option will be converted to reflect an option to buy collectively 100 LAC shares and Yx100 NewCo shares.\n\nThe strike price remains the same because the collective value is still the same but you do not have the discretion of choosing which shares you want to buy.  You either exercise for the \"package\" of both shares (as you originally entered into the option at) or you don't exercise.  Therefore, your \"bet\" on the call option is a bet on the combined entire value of the assets.\n\nOf course, there is always the chance I could be wrong, but this is how I have seen it done in the past.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Is the separation of the Company/Assets a result of the Government DOE ATVM Loan?**\n\nMy understanding, based on our research and discussions with management, is that this is not related to the DOE ATVM Loan facility or application, nor is required by either.\n\nThis was a decision that was being contemplated as far back as 2020.\n\nThe DOE ATVM loan will likely be announced (in conjunction with a Strategic Partner(s)) after an affirmation of the RoD is received from Judge Du.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Why is the timing occurring by \"end of 2023\"?**\n\nI suspect there may be a few reasons:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Thacker Pass Stabilization (i.e., Judge Du Decision, FS Update, DOE ATVM Loan, Strategic Partners/Offtake Agreements)\n\nManagement will want to have the judicial decision on the BLM Record of Decision done for \"Thacker Pass\" completed before the Spinoff as that asset represents the vast majority of the value for North America.\n\nThis will allow time to announce the Updated Feasibiity Study, the DOE ATVM Loan facility, and any Strategic Partners/Off-take Agreements for Thacker Pass.\n\nThis will also reduce share price volatility on the North American entity and help ensure they meet certain NYSE thresholds (a few of which are noted earlier to be listed and noted below to stay listed):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2hpnaw4osqx91.png?width=813&format=png&auto=webp&s=19429a2985ac243dbdd9a826418cb377574003f0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zo7x1eyrsqx91.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9566a81f534168231b156eedd8b12a2b5faa84f\n\n2. Accounting\n\nFrom an accounting perspective, it would be cleaner to do the separation of the assets at the end of the year.  This prevents having to restate many filings from prior years and allow for a cleaner comparable when compared against peer groups.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Will there be more dilution from new equity incentives being allocated to the new Entity's Employees?**\n\nPossibly.  It will depend on management's decision on how to handle the existing incentives in place (i.e., allow them to remain and add to it, or extinguish them and replace, or simply provide NewCo shares on top of existing LAC shares).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **How will this effect Ganfeng's ownership?**\n\nGanfeng will likely retain the same % shareholder ownership in both entities (i.e., LAC and NewCo) just like any other shareholder.\n\nIt is a misconception that there are any requirements by the Government or the DOE to have Ganfeng reduce its ownership or board position in order to be eligible for the DOE ATVM financing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What will the new name be?**\n\nIt appears from the Press Release NewCo will be called \"Lithium Americas\" and the Argentinian Operations will be called \"Lithium International\" (I just hope the ticker does not change to \"LINT\" as a result 8-)\n\nThis of course is subject to change between now and the actual separation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **What are potential negatives for a separation?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Reduction in geographic \"diversification\"\n2. Reduced Scale/scope (i.e., two smaller companies vs. one larger one) which could impede contract negotiations (however, given the production sizes planned for both entities I don't anticipate this being a problem)\n3. Increase in administrative costs/hiring (e.g., Senior management, accounting, legal, public listings, compliance, IT)\n4. Short-term disruption to the business (however, this will be mitigated since LAC today operates both geographies as indepedent business units)\n5. Separation of the soon-to-be Cash-flowing Entity from the Cash Starved Entity (e.g., we estimate that the new Capital Requirements for Phase 1 & Phase 2 will have risen from $1.06Bn from the 2019 Pre-FS, to between $1.6 Bn to $2Bn and, likely even more).  The balancing factor is that we suspect that LAC would only do this separation if they had the DOE ATVM Facility and/or Strategic Partner(s) in place to fund TP using LAC's cash balances at the time of the separation in the end of 2023 to fund any difference for TP).\n6. Some Limited Dilution from new/additional equity incentive compensation for new and existing management and board members.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **How successful are SpinOffs historically?**\n\nMcKinsey published a study in 2021 of \\~230 companies engaged in a spinoff:\n\n[www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/achieving-win-win-spin-offs](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/achieving-win-win-spin-offs)\n\nIn it, they categorized characteristics that they identified may be necessary to be classified as a \"win\" for the companies (e.g., Revenue Growth, Detailed Plans, Capital Funding/Allocation, Leadership Attention, etc..):  If done right, it can achieve significant annualized Total Returns to Shareholders:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/14bacu2hzqx91.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c94bfcc8b358d2a332168e6b531d2b7f6d49590\n\nAs added datapoints, in my own experiences with Spinoffs, they have created significant value for me (e.g., triple digit returns).\n\nIn this case, based on current valuations, I am optimistic (assuming Judge Du affirms the RoD), that the SpinOff will likewise unlock tremendous value for all LAC shareholders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**November 3, 2022 - Vancouver, Canada: Lithium Americas Corp.** **(TSX: LAC) (NYSE: LAC)** (\"**Lithium Americas**\" **or the** \"**Company**\") is pleased to announce that, after months of review by the Company, along with its advisors and the Board of Directors, it intends to advance a reorganization that will result in the separation of its North American and Argentine business units into two independent public companies (the “**Separation**”). The Separation will establish two separate companies that include:\n\n* An Argentina focused lithium company (“**Lithium International**”) owning Lithium Americas’ current interest in its Argentine lithium assets, including the near-production Caucharí-Olaroz lithium brine project in Jujuy, Argentina (“**Caucharí-Olaroz**”); and\n* A North America focused lithium company (“**Lithium Americas (NewCo)**”) owning the Thacker Pass lithium project in Humboldt County, Nevada (“**Thacker Pass**”) and the Company’s North American investments.\n\n“Following a comprehensive review of the merits of separating Lithium Americas into two public entities, we have reinforced our beliefs that separating the North American and Argentine businesses will facilitate unlocking the full potential of their significant asset base to deliver maximum value to our shareholders and other stakeholders,” said Jonathan Evans, President and CEO. “Upon completion of the Separation, Lithium Americas shareholders will retain ownership in two leading lithium businesses – one of the largest known lithium developments in North America, which is central to the U.S. domestic supply chain, and a near-term producing portfolio with significant growth from two high-quality projects in Argentina.”\n\n**TWO INDEPENDENT COMPANIES WITH INDUSTRY-LEADING LITHIUM ASSETS**\n\nUpon completion of the Separation, Lithium International will continue to hold the Company’s 44.8% interest in Caucharí-Olaroz and 100% interest in the Pastos Grandes lithium brine project in Salta, Argentina (“**Pastos Grandes**”). It will also hold the Company’s approximately 17% investment in Arena Minerals Inc. (TSX-V: AN) (“**Arena Minerals**”).\n\nMeanwhile, Lithium Americas (NewCo) will hold the Company’s 100% interest in Thacker Pass, one of the most advanced lithium projects currently known to be under development in the U.S., as well as the Company’s investments in Green Technology Metals Limited (ASX: GT1) and Ascend Elements, Inc.\n\n**BENEFITS OF SEPARATION**\n\nThe Company has two distinct industry-leading business units in its current portfolio, each of which has assets with significant value to be unlocked. Through a separation of the North American and Argentine focused business units, each are expected to benefit from strategic focus and enhanced operating flexibility to drive long-term growth and value.\n\nLithium Americas (NewCo) shareholders will benefit from the value created by financing and developing one of the largest lithium resources in the U.S. The Company is moving Thacker Pass towards production and has received all federal and state permits needed to commence construction, with a ruling on the Record of Decision appeal expected in early 2023. On July 20, 2022, the Company celebrated the inauguration of its Lithium Technical Development Center in Reno, Nevada (“**LiTDC**”), which was developed to demonstrate the processing of Thacker Pass ore. The LiTDC achieved battery-quality specifications with product samples being produced for potential customers and partners. Thacker Pass is aligned with the U.S. national agenda to enhance domestic supply of critical minerals and has the potential to be a leading near-term source of lithium for the North American battery supply chain.\n\nLithium International will be focused on ramping up Caucharí-Olaroz to bring Stage 1 operations of 40,000 tonnes per annum lithium carbonate to production in the first half of 2023. Once at full capacity, Caucharí-Olaroz will be the largest known new battery-quality lithium carbonate brine operation to come into production in over 20 years. Lithium International will also be focused on further maximizing shareholder value within its Argentinian portfolio from a Stage 2 expansion at Caucharí-Olaroz and advancing regional growth opportunities through Pastos Grandes and the Company’s collaboration with Arena Minerals.\n\n**SEPARATION PROCESS**\n\nIt is anticipated that the Separation will be completed by way of Plan of Arrangement under the laws of British Columbia, with each shareholder of the Company retaining their proportionate interest in shares of the Company, which would become Lithium International, and receiving newly issued shares of Lithium Americas (NewCo) in proportion to their then-current ownership of the Company.\n\nThe Company is preparing to file an application to the Canada Revenue Agency (“**CRA**”) to confirm the Separation by way of a spin-off of Lithium Americas (NewCo) will occur on a tax-deferred basis for the purposes of the *Income Tax Act (Canada)*. The Company also intends for the Separation to occur on a tax-deferred basis for shareholders resident in the U.S. for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The execution plan currently provides for completion of the Separation by the end of 2023.\n\nLithium Americas (NewCo) and Lithium International are expected to build on the teams the already in place in North America and Argentina. Jonathan Evans intends to remain the President and CEO of Lithium Americas (NewCo).\n\nAn execution plan will be released as the details of the Separation are finalized, including the formal naming of the two separated companies, allocation of the assets, liabilities and capital structures, listing information, governance structures, as well as their respective Boards of Directors and senior management teams.\n\nThe Separation will be subject to customary conditions and approvals, including completion of an Arrangement Agreement and Plan of Arrangement, receipt of the CRA ruling, the receipt of all required third party, court, tax, stock exchange and regulatory approvals and the final approval of each the Company’s Board of Directors and shareholders at a meeting expected to be held to consider the Separation transaction.\n\nBMO Capital Markets is serving as the financial advisor and McCarthy Tétrault LLP, Cassels Brock & Blackwell LLP, and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP are serving as the legal counsel to the Company through the Separation process.\n\nUntil the Separation is complete, Lithium Americas will continue to operate as a single company.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe view this announcement as an overall positive event and are confident that the CEO, Joanathan Evans, would not choose to separate the assets and remain the CEO of the North American assets (i.e., the future \"Lithium Americas\" post the Spinoff) unless he was extremely confident that Thacker Pass's RoD would be affirmed, financing was ready (e.g., DOE ATVM Loan, Strategic Partner(s)), and the updated Feasibility Study was strong and positive.\n\nWe believe that the company is trading at a floor value equivalent to the value of Cauchari-Olaroz Phase 1 alone (as do other equity analysts) and the upside additional value from Thacker Pass, Cauchari-Olaroz Phase 2, Pastos Grandes, GT1 and Arena Minerals can drive signifcant returns for the company and shareholders going forward.\n\nWe hope that helps explain some of the issues,\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

These high magnesium smectites have lithium concentrations up to 5000 ppm.\n\nTom then explains the illitization enrichment process that leads to the highest lithium concentrations of up to 12,000 ppm, and how in the case of the McDermitt Caldera this concentration occurred under high temperature rather than high pressure, which is what allows this deposit to occur so close to the surface. He explains where the lithium occurs inside these clay minerals or between the sheets.\n\nTom finishes up with an explanation of the split between[ Lithium Americas](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/) and Lithium Argentina, and why he’s lucky to be working with a team who understands the long term value created by fundamental science.\n\nGet more Tom:\n\n[https://www.tombenson.rocks/](https://www.tombenson.rocks/)\n\n[https://twitter.com/thomasrbenson](https://twitter.com/thomasrbenson)\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasrbenson/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasrbenson/)  \n\n\nDr. Benson received his Ph.D. in volcanology from Stanford University in 2017 for his research on global lithium resources associated with large magma chambers.

    "title": "Lithium Q3'22 Earnings Release & Our Analysis (10/27/22)",
    "selftext": "Below (towards the bottom of this post) is a link to and a copy of the Third Quarter 2022 earnings release from Lithium Americas.\n\nMost notable items from the release are as follows:\n\n**1. Commissioning**\n\nCommissioning began in late Q3'22 for key areas of the processing plant\n\nCommissioning is expected to continue all the way into the first half of 2023 (in conjunction with the completion of the purification process - this appears to be a shift by one quarter relative the prior quarter's estimated timeline).\n\n**2. Construction & Purification Deferral**\n\nConstruction completion of the purification process deferred to 1st half of 2023\n\nThe decision to defer the completion of the purification process by one quarter is geared around a focus on selling the \"technical grade\" production sooner at a slightly lower price point (e.g., estimated at 5% below battery grade) to take advantage of near-term elevated pricing levels and cash flows.\n\nFrom the quarterly filing:  \"Prior to completion of the entire purification process and achievement of commercial production, the project is planned to produce lithium carbonate product of lower than battery-grade, which is expected to be sold by the Company and Ganfeng to third parties. \"\n\nAs such, we expect first sales of technical grade production to begin in Q1'23 (although it will be low quantities).  Pursuant to the original Feasibility Study, we expect production to be in the range of 15k to 20k tonnes of largely technical grade production for 2023.\n\nThe completion of the construction of the purification elements in Q2'23 is one quarter later than expected, but the sales pricing differential will not have a material impact on financials (i.e., \\~5% lower price of a low production level at the start of 2023 for just one to two quarters).\n\n**3. Production Ramp-up**\n\nManagement has indicated they will provide an update on production and ramp-up by year-end.\n\nHistorically, the Feasibility Study for CO anticipated a \\~18 month ramp-up period (i.e., the amount of time from production start \\[at a technical grade\\] to reach full production and battery-grade quality levels).\n\nBelow is an excerpt from the Cauchari Olaroz technical report 43-101 from October 19th, 2020:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xmtzogsjehw91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1d86982ad215fbee3bf4d83b98dac1714a74ea2\n\nWe expect that CO will achieve \"full Production\" in the back-half of 2024 (although our research indicates there is a possibility to to accelerate this time frame to full production levels sometime in the first half of 2024).\n\n**4. Capital Costs**\n\nCapital Costs (based on Official Argentine Exchange Rates) rose to $852MM (with about $63MM remaining to be spent in capital costs, of which 49% or $31MM are remaining due from LAC's portion).\n\nThis is the most confusing aspect of the earnings release in understanding the Argentina Currency Market.  Effectively, Argentina has multiple \"exchange rates\".\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-12/from-coldplay-shows-to-world-cup-argentina-mixes-exchange-rates](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-12/from-coldplay-shows-to-world-cup-argentina-mixes-exchange-rates)\n\nAs a result, from one perspective, the capital cost of the project has increased based on the \"official rate\"; however, from the actual \"market\" exchange rate being paid by LAC, the exchange rate is much more favorable and the capital cost differential relative to the $741MM last announced will not be materially different as a result.\n\n**5. Pastos Grandes**\n\nA Pastos Grandes final decision for Construction is expected in the 2nd half of 2023\n\nPlacing this in context, the Pastos Grandes construction start decision will likely be in collaboration with Arena Minerals (of which LAC owns between 17% and 23%-with warrants) and Ganfeng (who owns 19.9% of Arena Minerals); both of whom own adjoining territories/projects with Arena Minerals.\n\nThe timing of the construction start decision will also benefit from the ramp-up on 2023 cash flows of CO which we expect to be used to fund the development of the project over time (from Q4'23 through 2026).\n\n**6. Cultural Assessment**\n\n\"***No areas of  archeological significance were identified at Thacker Pass\"***\n\nSince this assessment was overseen by the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribe, this will lend further credence that there is no evidence to back-up claims of Thacker Pass being involved with the Massacre that took place outside the territory.  This, in conjunction with the Collaboration Agreement with the same tribe, are further indications of local tribal support.\n\nIt is unclear if LAC will be able to introduce this information at the 1/5/23 oral argument hearings or not, but inevitably the court is or will become aware of it.\n\nThe court, based on prior statements in the filings, does not seem to ascribe any credence to those tribal claims due to the lack of evidence as it is.\n\n**7.  Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management \"EPCM\"**\n\nFrom the Quarterly Filing:\n\n\" EPCM Contractor The Company is in the final stages of evaluating proposals to select an EPCM firm to execute the development and  construction of Thacker Pass. In parallel, the Company continues to build out the development execution team with  key hires \"\n\nThe EPCM process was begun in Q2'22 and LAC is clearly moving ahead with confidence that the Record of Decision on Thacker Pass will be affirmed by Q1'23 in time for the Spring Construction start.\n\n**8. Thacker Pass Feasibility Sudy**\n\nIn the press release it states:\n\n\"***The timing for completion of a feasibility study is now scheduled for Q1 2023, in order to reflect ongoing feedback from strategic partnership and financing process, results of LiTDC operations and to align with the anticipated timing of the ROD appeal ruling***\\*\\*.\"\\*\\*\n\nIn the quarterly filing it adds:\n\n\"Capital costs are expected to substantially increase from the estimates in the 2018 pre-feasibility study (“PFS”) due to processing and related infrastructure changes and the results of engineering and testing, additional requirements from the permitting process, incorporation of increased  capacity, as well as external factors such as inflationary pressures and supply chain considerations.\"\n\nBelow is an excerpt from the prior 2018 Prefeasibility Study\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ggojldeehw91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=16aaaea7d8da5811f84606191a17e3824de6c377\n\nNote:  Indirect costs reflect costs for procurement and construction  management of these projects\n\nContingencies can be explained and further broken down as follows:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/payhfsj2cmw91.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=fac00e206f76a68346565f91f9f3dc18cd6c5c13\n\nLooking towards 2023, we expect capital costs to rise from the $1.06Bn due to:\n\na. Expansion on capacity from 60k tonnes per annum to 80k tonnes per annum\n\nb. Inflation (as adjusted from the past 4 years)\n\nc. Supply Chain constraints\n\nd. processing and related infrastructure changes\n\ne. results of engineering and testing\n\nf. additional requirements from the permitting process (which should only require an amendement to the existing permit and not \"starting from scratch\" on the permitting process according to management)\n\nAs a result, we expect total capital costs to rise to >$1.5Bn in scope (exactly how much \"over\" that $1.5Bn estimate is unclear at this stage and we realize it could be significantly more - we are strictly basing our estimates based on the delta in capital cost inflation in other projects we have seen and a prorata the expansion in capacity).\n\nAdditionally, we expect operating costs to increase significantly. Below is a summary excerpt from the 2018 TP Pre-Feasibility Study regarding TP Project Operating Costs:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cei5fg4m0ow91.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdb46449724230a5d7ff8e4b27676bdc388d880e\n\nSulfuric Acid Prices alone have run up from \\~$138/ton in Aug 2018 to \\~$307/ton today (particularly in the last 1.5 years):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vz2b93la1ow91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=924c0687ebd6949d6104d63841b28ddb17c8d216\n\nDespite the large increase in capital expenses and operating expenses, we believe this will be more than offset by:\n\nA. The elevated price levels for productions sales of Lithium Carbonate\n\nB. Increased production volumes anticipated resulting from the larger second phase of TP\n\nC. Lower Cost of Capital/Funding than originally anticipated (i.e., 4% to 4.5% - see DOE ATVM Funding below).\n\nD. Foreign Exchange Rates\n\nWe can see that the USD has strengthened against the Argentinian Peso significantly since August 2018 (having fallen 83% from 0.037 pesos/USD to 0.0064 pesos/USD):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/peggqbb22ow91.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=665584a1ced8e8f895e534dd57936b09e26b0f61\n\nThis is partially offset by the high inflation rate Argentina experienced during that same time frame of \\~386%:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mk1am5mf3ow91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8488e70f02abcdc9c3830a0049a90fe70f21e6a9\n\nOf course, the above are just general examples and it is hard to truly estimate the final costs, but the above data is meant to give you an understanding of direction and approximate magnitudes for these two counterbalancing factors.\n\nIn the end, the timing for Phase 1 first production is likely to be 2.5 to 3 years after a decision from Judge Du.  If construction were to start in the Spring (e.g., April 2023), this would imply a first production yield in the second half of 2026.\n\nIt is unlikely that CO cash flows will be used to fund this capital requirement as LAC appears intent on separating the two assets (i.e., North America and South America) and any Cauchari-Olaroz Cash Flows will likely go to fund the development of CO Phase 2 and/or Phase 1 of Pastos Grandes (or further acquisitions/investments into the Pastos Grandes basin such as Arena Minerals).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**9. DOE ATVM Funding**\n\nIt is our opinion that the  DOE ATVM Funding appears to be in place and an announcement is pending final approval/announcement which both LAC and the DOE are choosing to hold off announcing pending Judge Du's final Decision.\n\nThe deferral of a DOE ATVM loan announcement does not appear to be a function of any concerns with the financing decision, but more a decision of \"prudence\" to await the approval of Judge Du (based on our research into the matter) before LAC will announce the financing and strategic partner.\n\nWe believe the DOE ATVM funding is in place and, and if it follows the traditional terms of prior loans, it will have a cost of capital of between 4% to 4.5% given today's treasury rates (far below the 6% to10% cost of capital contemplated by other Feasibility Study NPV Analyses).\n\nIf all goes well, we also expect the DOE ATVM financing to cover between 50% to 60% of the total project cost (although it is unclear if the DOE ATVM loan will cover only phase 1 or both phases).\n\nThe remaining balance will likely be funded through one or more of the following avenues:\n\nStrategic Partner/Customer Investment/Contribution\n\nThe Cash Balances of LAC\n\nAnd with possible other contributions from additional Partner/Customer Investment/Contributions, Convertible Debt Offering, Non-Convertible Debt Offering, or an Equity Offering.\n\nFrom the Quarterly Filings we see multiple references to \"Strategic Partners/Customers\":\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5nqplfioehw91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=67488dd30339eaa724873169eb4b8088bc9487c6\n\nIt is our opinion that there is already a Partner/Customer in hand and everything is awaiting Judge Du's final order at this stage which is expected to be received by the end of Q1'23.\n\n**10.   Cash Balances**\n\nLAC ended Q3'22 with $392MM in cash & Cash equivalents/bank deposit accounts.\n\nWith their existing burn rate and anticipated remaining Capex (\\~$31MM - much of which will be spent in early 2023), we expect LAC to end the year with >$350MM.\n\n**11. Ascend Elements**\n\nIt appears Lithium Americas is dipping its toes into \"recycled\" waters with a $5MM investment in Ascend Elements.  More details on that $300MM capital raise can be found here:\n\n[https://www.finsmes.com/2022/10/ascend-elements-raises-300m-in-funding.html](https://www.finsmes.com/2022/10/ascend-elements-raises-300m-in-funding.html)\n\nThe overall financing was for $300M in equity and debt financing, including $200m in Series C equity investments.\n\nFrom an article/PR published earlier today:\n\n\" The round was led by Fifth Wall Climate, and joined by SK ecoplant, with participation from Oman Investment Authority,  Lithium Americas Corporation, GLy Capital Management New Mobility Fund, Mirae Asset Capital & LS, Shinhan GIB,  Hitachi Ventures, InMotion Ventures, TDK Ventures, Orbia Ventures, At One Ventures, TRUMPF Venture, and Doral Energy-Tech Ventures. This funding is in addition to two recently awarded grants totaling $480 million from the Department of Energy.\n\nLed by CEO Mike O’Kronley, Ascend Elements is a provider of sustainable, closed-loop battery materials solutions. From EV battery recycling to commercial-scale production of lithium-ion battery precursor (pCAM) and cathode active materials (CAM), the company is revisiting the production of sustainable lithium-ion battery materials. Its proprietary Hydro-to-Cathode direct precursor synthesis technology produces new CAM from spent lithium-ion cells in a different way, resulting in reduced cost, improved performance, and lowered GHG emissions.\n\nThe announcement follows recently disclosed plans to invest up to $1 billion to build a sustainable lithium-ion battery materials facility in Hopkinsville, Ky. The manufacturing facility, known as “Apex 1”, will produce enough lithium-ion battery pCAM and sustainable CAM to equip up to 250,000 electric vehicles per year.\"\n\nMore details can be found on the associated DOE Funding Announcement page:\n\n[DOE BIL Battery FOA-2678 Selectee Fact Sheets (energy.gov)](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-10/DOE%20BIL%20Battery%20FOA-2678%20Selectee%20Fact%20Sheets%20-%201_2.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ciqjyw5rehw91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b57de6cf8afa008d8ba3639b923d6b60d753761\n\n**12. Green Technology Metals (\"GT1\")**\n\nWe have a variety of Subreddit posts on the collaboration of LAC and GT1 (of which LAC owns 5.2%), so we will summarize that GT1 represents an opportunity for Thacker Pass to aid in the development of a Vertically Integrated Battery Supply Chain (taking particular advantage of the Inflation Reduction Act benefits).\n\nWe will add, a very recent interview (10/25/22) with the CEO of GT1, Luke Cox:\n\n[Green Technology Metals Discussion on Progress (10/25/22) : LithiumAmerica (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LithiumAmerica/comments/ydzyn3/green_technology_metals_discussion_on_progress/)\n\nWhich indicates Lithium Americas is a potential partner for \"Downstream Processing\" (e.g., refinement of Lithium to Lithium Carbonate or Lithium Hydroxide?)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**13. Separation of US (i.e., North American) and Argentinian (i.e., South American) Assets**\n\nBased on our research, we do not believe this separation is a requirement by any party (e.g., DOE, Government, etc..).\n\nInstead, this is an effort that was under consideration before 2021 when LAC identified an opportunity to maximize and unlock shareholder value by allowing investors to buy into either geographic region rather than being forced to take both.  The benefits of scale and diversification appeared to be outweighed by the negatives of being forced to deal with jurisdictions of little desire.   We have seen this in other mining projects we have encountered in the past (e.g., Gold Resource and Fortitude Gold) and view this as a positive developed if and when announced.\n\nAgain, this separation appears to have nothing to do with any financing, government/DOE or partner requirements.\n\nCurrently, both North and South American organizations already operate as separate and nearly independent business units (with effectively only shared corporate administrative functions).  The separation should be relatively easy and we expect the management team in South America to assume responsibility for the new South American entity and existing corporate management of LAC to assume management for a North American entity (with HQ remaining in Canada as that is the common practice for most mining companies in North America).\n\nThe spinoff will likely create two separate and independent public companies with two separate and independent management teams.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nLAC Third Quarter 2022 Results\n\n[www.lithiumamericas.com/\\_resources/news/nr\\_20221027.pdf](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/_resources/news/nr_20221027.pdf)\n\nLithium Americas Reports Third Quarter 2022 Results October 27, 2022\n\nVancouver, Canada: Lithium Americas Corp. (TSX: LAC) (NYSE: LAC) (“Lithium Americas” or the “Company”) has reported financial and operating results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2022 (“Q3 2022”).\n\n**HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n**Argentina**\n\nCaucharí-Olaroz\n\n• Construction continues to progress towards production with ***key areas of the processing plant commenced commissioning in late Q3 2022***.\n\n• With construction nearing completion, focus remains on prioritizing production volume over product quality during ramp-up. o As previously announced in July 2022, ***construction on a portion of the purification process designed to achieve battery-quality was deferred to the first half of 2023***. o The Company expects to provide an ***update and guidance on production ramp-up schedule around the end of 2022.***\n\n• Due primarily to the low official Argentine exchange rate and high local inflation, ***capital cost estimates at the official exchange rate have been revised to $852 million (on a 100% basis), up 15% from $741 million previously; however, at the substantially more favorable market-based exchange rate available and the streamlined production plan, the Company expects that there will be no material change to its total funding requirements for Stage 1.***\n\no As of September 30, 2022, ***85% of the budget has been spent with a substantial portion deferred until 2023***, to complete the purification process.\n\no As of September 30, 2022, the ***Company had $63 million (49% share) in capital costs remaining at the official Argentine exchange rate***, requiring ***funding of an estimated $31 million based on the latest market-based exchange rate***.\n\n• Development planning for Stage 2 ***expansion of at least 20,000 tonnes per annum of lithium carbonate equivalent*** continues to progress to align with completion of Stage 1.\n\no In Q2 2022, the ***seven local communities in the vicinity of the project approved the proposed expansion***.\n\n**Pastos Grandes**\n\n• The Company continues to advance the Pastos Grandes $30 million development plan, with completion of the plan and a resulting ***construction decision expected for the second half of 2023***.\n\no Following the recent exploration results from the adjacent property owned by Arena Minerals Inc. (TSXV: AN) and additional modelling of the basin, the ***Company is updating its exploration plan***.\n\n**United States**\n\n**Thacker Pass**\n\n• The Lithium Technical Development Center (“LiTDC”) in Reno continues to operate based on the Thacker Pass flowsheet processing raw ore to final battery-quality lithium carbonate.\n\no As of September 2022, over 100 tonnes of lithium ore were collected at Thacker Pass to feed the LiTDC to produce product samples for potential customers and partners.\n\no Results of ongoing test work to de-risk each step of the flowsheet continues to be in line with expectations.\n\n• In Q2 2022, cultural work on approximately 13,000 acres was completed as required under the  National Environmental Policy Act and conducted by an independent consultant, with the oversight  and assistance of the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribe (“Tribe”). ***No areas of  archeological significance were identified at Thacker Pass.***\n\n• In October 2022, the ***Company signed a Community Benefits Agreement with the Tribe***, to establish a framework for continued collaboration and define long-term benefits for the Tribe.\n\n• On August 11, 2022, briefings were submitted for the appeal of the issuance of the Record of Decision (“ROD”) for Thacker Pass. The US District Court, District of Nevada has scheduled an ***oral hearing for January 5, 2023***.\n\n• Lithium Americas is moving ahead with pre-construction activities, including the ***selection of an engineering, procurement and construction management firm to execute the development and construction plan for Thacker Pass***.\n\n• The Company is also evaluating potential investment, partnership and supply agreements to support the development of a North American supply chain. In addition, Lithium Americas ***continues to progress the U.S. Department of Energy Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing loan program application***.\n\n• The ***timing for completion of a feasibility study is now scheduled for Q1 2023, in order to reflect ongoing feedback from strategic partnership and financing process, results of LiTDC operations and to align with the anticipated timing of the ROD appeal ruling***.\n\n**Corporate**\n\n• As at September 30, 2022, the Company had $392 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits, with an additional $75 million in available credit.\n\n• On July 18, 2022, the ***Company made an equity investment in Ascend Elements***, Inc. (“Ascend Elements”), a ***US-based lithium-ion battery recycling and engineered material company***, by way of a subscription for Series C-1 preferred shares for ***$5 million***.\n\n• On September 20, 2022, the ***Company entered a Strategic Collaboration Agreement with Green Technology Metals Ltd***. (ASX:GT1) (“GT1”), in which it owns a ***5% stake***, to advance a common goal of developing an ***integrated lithium chemical supply chain in North America***.\n\n• In September 2022, the Company was recognized on the TSX30 for the second consecutive year, ranking as one of the top 30 performers on the TSX.\n\n• The Company ***continues to advance a potential separation of its US and Argentina operations*** ***to unlock shareholder value and better position each business to pursue its independent strategy and growth***.\n\n**TECHNICAL INFORMATION**\n\nThe Technical Information in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Rene LeBlanc, PhD, SME, Chief Technical Officer of Lithium Americas, and a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101.\n\n**FINANCIAL RESULTS**\n\nSelected consolidated financial information is presented as follows:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fn211kltehw91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b22987b5b0cdd734c438a640253197f030d4a9ce\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2022, total assets increased primarily due to the acquisition of Millennial Lithium Corp., and investments in GT1 and Ascend Elements. Total long-term liabilities decreased due to $12.8 million decrease in fair value of convertible senior notes derivative liability and repayment of $24.7 million limited recourse loan facility balance and accumulated interest.\n\nThe higher net loss in Q3 2022 compared to Q3 2021 is primarily attributable to $18.4 million loss on change in fair value of convertible notes derivative driven by an increase in market value of the Company’s shares during the three months ended September 30, 2022, and $8.3 million share of loss of Cauchari-Olaroz which was primarily related to foreign exchange loss on the project’s loans and deferred taxes during the three months ended September 30, 2022.\n\nThis news release should be read in conjunction with Lithium Americas’ condensed consolidated interim financial statements and management's discussion and analysis for the nine months ended September 30,  2022, which are available on the Company’s website and SEDAR.

    "title": "Updates on Lithium Americas and What the Future Holds",
    "selftext": "There has been a lot of speculation on Lithium Americas of late, and I thought it would be helpful to share a compilation of information which may assist investors frame some of the issues:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n1. Judge Du Record of Decision (RoD) Status\n\nRecently, two of the tribes voluntarily withdrew from the tribal related case.\n\nThe tribal case (for the remaining parties) and environmental activist case still are pending.\n\nBased on commentary in the filings, I believe it is unlikely that Judge Du will find in favor of the tribes (there is a degree of skepticism noted in the filings which seems to indicate she is not \"buying\" the tribal arguments).\n\nAs for the environmental activists arguments regarding improper/rushed permitting by the BLM, Judge Du seems to be open to listening to the arguments, so the final outcome is not quite as certain.\n\nHowever, her previously stated desires to get a decision prior to construction season and her more recent determination of a timeline seems to indicate a need to get this case done sooner rather than later (which may indicate a desire to finish to enable LAC to begin construction).\n\nThis, combined with the public (state and county levels) and executive branch stated opinions, I suspect she will find in favor of the BLM (indirectly LAC).\n\nWe should know an answer by Q3 (with some indications/timelines pointing as early as August).\n\nIn the meantime, LAC has preliminary construction work planned for the beginning of the 2nd half of 2022.  What that exactly means is unclear but I suspect it will be related to infrastructure/planning.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n2. Permits\n\nAll three remaining permits were approved.  However, the water permit has been appealed.  I don't anticipate this appeal being an issue as there is nothing of merit that seems to be of concern in the filings and will likely be overturned.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n3. Lithium Carbonate Pricing\n\nSince March, Jon Evans has made effort to inform the public that there is a significant distinction between Chinese Lithium Spot and Contracted pricing.\n\nChinese Lithium Spot pricing has seen a rapid acceleration over the last few quarters to over $70k/tonne.\n\nHowever, Jon Evans, makes note of the public filings of the Lithium Majors and the contracted pricing they have (which may have floors and ceilings tied to market rates) which have also risen but only to $20k to $30k/tonne.\n\nIt's also important to note, that Gangfeng controls this \"market pricing\" negotiation for the majority of Argentina's production (with only a small part in the hands of LAC's control) for the Cauchari asset in Argentina.\n\nOriginally, up until the last few days, Jon had been quoting $20k to $30k per tonne as the contract pricing range.  Most recently he stated the range is $20k to $35k per tonne.\n\nI would take this increase as a positive indication that LAC will likely be at the upper end of this range (i.e., $25k to $35k per tonne) and I am assuming between $25k to $30k as my most likely case scenarios.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n4. DOE\n\nAs early as January (possibly earlier), LAC has been exploring raising several hundred millions of dollars from the DOE as a means to fund TP.\n\nIt is likely that this will be in lieu of finding a strategic partner to fund the TP project.  A draft application was previously submitted.\n\nAs of Friday last week, the DOE has given approval for LAC to formally apply.\n\nThis is a good sign since the DOE has to authorize for an application to proceed (and only after due diligence has been done).\n\nThe DOE has informed LAC that they are eager to do this application and that the application could be approved as early as within 4 months of submission.\n\nWhat does this mean if approved?:\n\n\\- Reduced dilution to LAC (since they don't have to finance the loan with equity or convertible debt to a strategic partner)\n\n\\- Lower costs (since the DOE is charging US treasury rates)\n\n\\- Certainty of funding (since the government is unlikely to have issues funding)\n\n\\- Opportunities for future funding on future Nevada/US projects through this established relationship\n\n\\- It will likely require the separation of the non-US assets from the US assets to ensure the funds are being allocated appropriately (which is driving the preliminary discussions on a spinoff)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion, this is one of the most advantageous tailwinds for LAC and a good situation to have.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n5. Buyers\n\nWhile the Cauchari production is mostly spoke for by GangFeng, there is a small portion allocated for LAC's discretion.\n\nAs such, and also in regards to future production of TP, LAC is in ongoing discussions with:\n\na. Multiple US OEMS\n\n(all the majors, notably, Jon Evans has mentioned a couple of times that they have \"serious interest\" from American Based OEMs such as Ford and General Motors and Non-US OEMs specifically Korean and Japanese manufacturers)\n\nb. Suppliers (e.g., Battery Manufacturers)\n\nI would imagine that LAC will contract with US manufacturers for both short term needs of Lithium over the next few years in part supplied out of LAC's share of the Argentinian production and thereafter fulfilled out of TP as the demand curve continues to escalate.\n\nJon Evans has already stated the following:\n\n\"I am sold out the day I start, and I am sold out for the next decade\"\n\nBuyers are looking for \"china free supply chains\" and US sellers are looking for US based production.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n6. CapEx and Operational Costs\n\nJon Evans has indicated that, due to inflation, we should anticipate that the CapEx requirements for the upcoming projects (e.g., Thacker Pass and Millenial) as well as operational costs.  However, he has indicated that the elevated LCE pricing (relative to the economic engineering studies) should more than compensate that).\n\nWe have seen evidence in this in the CapEx overrun on Cauchari as announced earlier this year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n7. Timelines\n\nCauchari is expected to begin production in Q4 2022 and rampup throughout 2023 to full production\n\nThacker Pass is expected to begin preliminary construction planning in the 2nd half of 2022 and begin construction in the tail-end of Q1 2023 or early Q2 2023.  Construction will take between 2 to 3 years (i.e., completion no later than 2026 assuming no further surprises, issues or delays).\n\nMillenial is expected to begin a review of engineering in 2023 with construction to begin shortly afterwards (unclear as to when that will be).  I have heard claims that production could begin as early as 2026, but I have not been able to fully confirm this.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n8. Further expansions\n\na. LAC continues to expand its minority stake in Arena Minerals and there is always potential for an acquisition of that mine as it continues to be developed (note: Gangfeng may be involved)\n\nb. LAC's team is exploring further expansion/acquisition opportunities in Nevada and Canada\n\nc. TP currently has a resource of 14MM Tonnes.  LAC sees signifcant opportunities for further stepout opportunities on the TP project to tap into the 120MM+ tonnes of Lithium still in their project area within the Caldera and continue to grow their productive capacity to meet both Global and US needs.\n\nd. Jon Evans indicated he sees a Nevada based Ecosystem where mining, chemical processing/refining, manufacturing, production, and recycling all take place in Nevada to minimize costs as well as envrionmental impact.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n9. Defense Production Act (DPA)\n\nLast week, we saw the addition of Lithium to the list of critical minerals.  This is important as it shows federal government support for the domestic development and sourcing of Lithium.\n\nWhile this doesn't accelerate or bypass permitting, it does provide a potential alternative source of potential funding.\n\nThere is a $750 million fund that has been set up and administered by the Defense Department for the funding of projects related to minerals/efforts deemed critical for national defense (e.g., lithium, nickel, graphite, cobalt and manganese)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI hope that helps someone out there in framing some of the issues on LAC,\n\nHappy Investing,\n\nIRR\n\nPS: If you like this, share it on other social media and invite others to join this Reddit.

    "title": "Update: Lithium Americas Submits for DOE Loan Application & Explores Possible Spinoff",
    "selftext": "This morning, Lithium Americas announced that it has submitted a DRAFT loan application with the US Department of Energy for the Thacker Pass project and is also exploring a geographic spinoff (i.e., North American vs. South American assets) as well as discussions with strategic partners.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe link to the press release is here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.lithiumamericas.com/news/lithium-americas-submits-draft-loan-application-to-the-us-department-of-energy-exploring-possible-separation-of-its-us-lithium-business](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/news/lithium-americas-submits-draft-loan-application-to-the-us-department-of-energy-exploring-possible-separation-of-its-us-lithium-business)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Let's first examine the Loan :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDetails on the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (\"ATVM\") direct loan program are outlined in the link below as well as a detailed video overview:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.energy.gov/lpo/products-services/advanced-technology-vehicles-manufacturing-loan-program#valueprop](https://www.energy.gov/lpo/products-services/advanced-technology-vehicles-manufacturing-loan-program#valueprop)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe loan can be provided to entities all across the value chain, including components such as batteries and the process and manufacturing of critical minerals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBenefits include:\n\n1. Senior Secured\n2. Fixed Rate Debt\n3. Priced at US Treasury Bond Rate with no credit Spread (i.e., LOW COST!!!)\n4. Sole or Co-Lender\n5. Long tenors\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe program has $17.7Bn in lending capacity, of which, $8Bn has already been accounted for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTypically, when a project, such as Thacker Pass, is getting ready to launch construction it will explore finding a strategic partner(s) to split a portion of the equity (usually 30% to 50% of the overal project cost) and seek debt financing (i.e., 50% to 70% of the overall project cost).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the case of LAC, for the equity side, they have the choice to:\n\n&#x200B;\n\na. Find a strategic partner (e.g., a Battery Manufacturer, or EV Auto manufacturer, or one of the Lithium Mining Majors like Albemarle or SQM) who will either contribute capital and/or an off-take agreement in exchange for an equity interest in the project\n\n&#x200B;\n\nb. Fund the equity contribution themselves (but LAC capital is limited as they are still pending production on Cauchari and have limited cash and cash flow as much of the cash is spoken for on project development as well as exploration and acquisitions (e.g., Millenial Lithium and Arena Minerals)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nc. Issue new equity (i.e., dilution) to fund the required equity\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe ATVM loan program fills in the debt financing gap (i.e., either as a sole lender or co-lender).  Given that the U.S. Treasury Bond Rates are priced with no credit spread, this would be a phenomenal rate if they can secure the loan.  Given that Lithium America is currently the largest deposit/resource in North America today and is on the critical minerals list, there is a high probability that the loan would be approved.  The final approval of the loan may or may not be pend the completion of the expanded feasibility study that LAC is conducting on Thacker Pass.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the end, this financing will eliminate any project financing risk and step up the value of the equity of the company quickly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Turning to the Separate into Two Entities / Spin-off\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is an interesting turn of events.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOften times when a Spin-off is done it is done to either unlock value due to perceived valuation mismatch where one division or mine is being weighed down by the metrics of another division/mine (i.e., in this case it may be because of the mining/political jurisdictions of Nevada vs. Argentina).  It also may be unlocking value by separating assets that are in two different stages of development (i.e., Cauchari is ready for production towards the end of this year and Thack Pass would only be ready for production sometime in 2026 or 2027 time frame).  In this situation it would try to maximize valuations on both assets by separating them so that they each are valued fully.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlternatively, another reason this might be being pursued at this moment may be by necessity due to the U.S. Loan Application which is directed to focus its lending only to US entities.  In that case, the spinoff may be contingent on receiving the loan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have seen, and participated in, this type of separation multiple of times in mining companies and have seen the \"unlocking of value\" (e.g., Fortitude Gold from Gold Resource).  In most cases, the current shareholders of LAC will receive an equity interest in the NewCo entity (i.e., SpinCo) and can make a decision on their own if they wish to retain interests in either, both or none of the companies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe negatives I find are relatively small, but important to note:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. The overall entity shrinks in size/scale which may or may not make it more difficult for one or both surviving entities to remain listed on the NYSE.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Negotiations or off-take agreements may be limited\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. There will likely be a cost increase as a result of having to create a new team/administrative staffing along with duplicating varioius external costs (e.g., legal, accounting, public filings, etc..).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. The loss of diversification from an asset basis\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately, the markets typically do not initially react favorably to a spinoff and only after, does it realize its value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis overall announcement is quite exciting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is only a DRAFT application on the loan and we will likely not have a resolution to either the loan or the spinoff until the final ruling on the Record of Decision is made sometime in Q3 of this year by Judge Du (per last week's announcement from management).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope you find this helpful and as exciting as I do,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIRR\n\n&#x200B;",

    "title": "Lithium Americas Again Boosts Projected Capital Costs at Flagship Lithium Project (11/1/22)",
    "selftext": "Below (towards the bottom of this post) is a recent article related to the Capital Cost increase noted in the Q3'22 Earnings Release from Lithium Americas:\n\nWhile the article does a good job in laying out the increases on the Cauchari-Olaroz Budget as well as the timing expectation for first production, there are a couple of key points to note:\n\n* **Capital Costs:**\n\nAs the author of the article does note, Capital Costs (based on Official Argentine Exchange Rates) rose to $852MM (with about $63MM remaining to be spent in capital costs, of which 49% or $31MM are remaining due from LAC's share) from a prior budget of $724MM.\n\nBut the author fails to address the \"market-based\" exchange rate.  Let's dive into that.\n\nThis is the most confusing aspect of the earnings release in understanding the Argentina Currency Market. Effectively, Argentina has multiple \"exchange rates\".\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-12/from-coldplay-shows-to-world-cup-argentina-mixes-exchange-rates](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-12/from-coldplay-shows-to-world-cup-argentina-mixes-exchange-rates)\n\nAs a result, from one perspective, the capital cost of the project has increased based on the \"official rate\"; however, from the actual \"market\" exchange rate being paid by LAC, the exchange rate is much more favorable and the capital cost differential relative to the $741MM last announced will not be materially different for Stage 1 as a result.\n\n* **First Production Timing**\n\nThe timing of production still remains within the prior guidance for \"late 2022\".\n\n* **Outsized cash flows**\n\nThe author of the article below ends with a off-handed final comment noting that the CO cash flows could be \"interesting\" given the current and forecasted prices for Lithium Carbonate.\n\nI thought it would be helpful to provide some further understanding of that.\n\nCO production is largely spoken through agreements with Ganfeng& Bangchek (i.e., accounting for 91% of total production) and the pricing for the Lithium Carbonate will be \"at market\" prices\n\nIt is likely the 9% remaining for LAC to decide will also be sold at \"at market\" prices to Ganfeng.\n\nWe can now try and estimate the value of those cash flows over the first 12 months of sales (i.e., 2023) by trying to estimate \"at market prices\".\n\nIn general, based on statements from LAC management, \"at market pricing\" is based on a quarterly look back done by a third party independent \"accounting\" firm.\n\nThat firm will look primarily at public Lithium producing companies who have reported (e.g., Allkem, SQM), for which we can already see a range of \\~$50k to \\~$54k per tonne for Q2'22 comps.  In addition they will look at spot prices (i.e., $75k/tonne) as well as private industrial data where available.\n\nIf you examine the original CO 2019 Feasibility Study:\n\n[LAC-NI-43-101-Updated-DFS-FINAL-Oct-19-2020.pdf (lithiumamericas.com)](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/_resources/pdf/investors/technical-reports/cauchari-olaroz/LAC-NI-43-101-Updated-DFS-FINAL-Oct-19-2020.pdf?v=0.810)\n\nThe cash flows shown in the Feasibility Study were based on a $12k lithium price point.  With the first year of ramp-up production (i.e., 2023) at -$275MM (i.e., a loss to CO) ramping up to full production (i.e., 2024) at $125MM (i.e., cash flow positive).\n\nHowever, if we instead apply the $50k/tonne as the new price point for the first year (i.e., \"at market\" pricing), this would imply total cash flows (after deducting for royalties and local taxes and federal taxes) in 2023 of approximately $279MM  (this is based on 19.6k tonnes produced during the first 12 months of production as it takes time to ramp up).   That is \\~$2/share in free cash flows based on a fully diluted (\"as if\" converted) share count of \\~$142MM shares.\n\nAt full production (to be achieved in 2024) of 40k tonnes/annum, cash flows would be closer to $475MM (or we over $3/share in free cash flows or an FCF yield of \\~12% at today's share price).\n\nIt is probably safe to say that CO operating costs (denominated in Argentinian Pesos) have also risen due to inflation but it will be partially balanced by the increase in the foreign exchange trading power of the US dollars vs. the Argentinian Peso and the \"actual\" market costs which are below the official exchange rate.\n\nRegardless, the cash flows for both 2022 and even more in 2023 will be significant and we can expected to continue to see outsized cash flows untill at least 2030 and beyond as Lithium demand continues to outstrip Lithium supply for the near term.\n\n* **Floor Value based on CO Value alone**\n\nThis is why Cowen and Morningstar (and myself) all believe that TP is trading at it's Cauchari-Olaroz value alone of $25/share with no credit for:\n\n1. The value and optionality for CO Phase 2\n2. The sizeable cash balances on LAC's hands (expected to be >$350MM after construction)\n3. The value and optionality of Thacker Pass Phase 1 or 2\n4. The value of the Pastos Grandes (purchased for $400MM)\n5. The value of LAC's 17%+ equity stake in and collaboration agreement with Arena Minerals\n6. The value of LAC's 5.2% equity stake in and collaboration agreement with GT1\n7. The value of LAC's $5MM equity stake in Ascend\n\n* **Equity Analysts**\n\nAnalysts are coming out of the woodwork reiterating \"buys\" or \"overweights\" since the earnings call:\n\nMorningstar - $65\n\nB. Riley - $41.00\n\nCanaccord Genuity Group - C$50.00\n\nPiper Sandler - $38.00\n\nDeutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft - $36.00\n\nTD Securities - C$40.00\n\nIf and when Judge Du affirms the RoD, we should expect to see a re-rating of all price targets to north of $40/share.\n\nI then expect, once the DOE ATVM is confirmed and annnounced alongside a strategic partner, than we should expect shares to climb well above $50/share or higher. \n\nMore to come soon (but all eyes and ears are on January 5th, 2023's upcoming hearing),\n\nIRR\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nBelow is the Article referenced above:\n\n[Lithium Americas Again Boosts Projected Capital Costs at Flagship Lithium Project | the deep dive](https://thedeepdive.ca/lithium-americas-again-boosts-projected-capital-costs-at-flagship-lithium-project/)\n\n***Lithium Americas Corp. (TSX: LAC)*** on Thursday released what must be considered a disappointing earnings report. The company does not yet generate revenue from its prospective lithium mining operations, so the explicit financial results are not as important as the increased capital spending budget announced for, plus what appears to be at least a slight production delay at, its flagship Cauchari-Olaroz lithium brine project in Argentina.\n\nLithium Americas owns 49% of Cauchari and China’s largest lithium company, Ganfeng Lithium, owns the balance, or 51%. Lithium Americas will operate the mine. Offtake agreements at market prices (which are very attractive) are in place for over 80% of Cauchari’s planned Stage 1 production.\n\nFor the second time in 7 ½ months, Lithium Americas increased Cauchari’s projected budget to US$852 million from US$741 million. (The budget was lifted in mid-March 2022 to US$741 million from US$641 million.) Lithium Americas blamed high inflation and foreign exchange issues for the higher projected spending.\n\nLithium Americas now expects early stage Cauchari production will begin in *late 4Q 2022*. Lithium Americas’ previous wording was that early-stage production would commence in *late 2022*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rkcyau4q2fx91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3309ef7f725b7bedd7df292bc3f9f2e562c67339\n\nDespite the seeming delay, Lithium Americas’ share of Cauchari’s cash flow when it begins production, particularly when it achieves full production, could be quite substantial. According to a Feasibility Study and Mineral Reserve Estimate with an effective date of September 30, 2020, the project could produce 40,000 tonnes of battery-grade lithium carbonate for 40 years (Stage 1 production). Based on assumptions of long-term lithium carbonate prices and operating costs of US$12,000 per tonne and US$3,600 per tonne, respectively, the project could generate average EBITDA of around US$300 million per year. However, since lithium carbonate delivered to China currently trades in the vicinity of US$75,000 per tonne, Cauchari’s annual cash flow could potentially be multiples of US$300 million.  \n\nLithium Americas has controlled its costs well as the build-out of Cauchari (fitfully) progresses. Its quarterly cash burn rate, defined as its operating cash flow deficit *plus* Cauchari-Olaroz capital expenditures, totaled about US$207 million over the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. In turn, Lithium Americas’ cash balance has deceased only moderately over the course of 2022, from US$511 million at year-end 2021 to US$392 million as of September 30, 2022. Debt (mostly convertible debt) was US$235 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bmx4yvvy2fx91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=969bb4b881a64069e44ab259309b67c62bc9de09\n\n**Despite the disappointing Cauchari budget news, Lithium Americas could represent an interesting opportunity as its cash flow, bolstered by high lithium prices, could be significant when the mine begins production**.\n\nLithium Americas Corp. last traded at $33.45 on the TSX Exchange. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nTo sum up:\n\n1. Capital Expenditures are not materially different (if taking account the \"market-based\" exchange rate\n2. The timing of first production is still within guidance\n3. Outsized Cash flows WILL be significant (as noted above)\n4. The floor value, based solely on CO, will be >$25/share\n5. Equity Analysts have been publishing price targets well north of today's current share price (which trades at floor value of Cauchari-Olaroz)\n\nHope that all helps put things in perspective,\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

    "selftext": "I was wondering if anyone had any info on the Lithium Nevada Project.  Is Lithium Nevada and Thacker Pass the same Project?\n\nI sometimes use AI Chat as a way to get info about companies and is usually a pretty good resource.  I was asking about other Lithium Americas projects and it mentioned the Lithium Nevada Project.  It seems pretty adamant that it is a different project than Thacker Pass.\n\n*\"Me:  Is the Lithium Nevada Project different from the Thacker Pass Project?* \n\n*AI:  Yes, the Lithium Nevada Project and the Thacker Pass Project are two separate projects located in different areas of Nevada, although both are being developed by Lithium Americas.*\n\n*The Lithium Nevada Project is located in the McDermitt Caldera in northern Nevada and is focused on developing a lithium deposit through the construction of an open-pit mine and processing facilities. The project is expected to produce battery-grade lithium hydroxide, which is a key component in electric vehicle batteries and energy storage systems.*\n\n*The Thacker Pass Project, on the other hand, is located in northwestern Nevada and is focused on developing a large-scale lithium deposit using an innovative extraction process called sulfuric acid leaching. This process involves the use of sulfuric acid to dissolve lithium from the claystone ore, which is then recovered and processed to produce battery-grade lithium carbonate.*\n\n*Both projects are expected to contribute to the growing demand for lithium, which is a critical component in the production of electric vehicle batteries and other clean energy technologies.

But the purification process to achieve battery-grade lithium carbonate is expected to start only early next year.\n\nAccording to the report, purchase agreements at current market prices are in place for more than 80% of Lithium America’s participation in the planned production of stage 1.\n\nMeanwhile, Lithium Americas and Ganfeng have begun planning stage 2, involving at least 20,000t/y, and continue to advance development of the exploration well field. Stage 2 is expected to start in 2023.\n\nGanfeng and Lithium Americas are entitled to 51% and 49% of production. Useful life is around 40 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h9ay4hwuk6v91.png?width=1057&format=png&auto=webp&s=a254f938f74c9660cfaeb20bcf28405d7d3ac7a3\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nCO remains on track for first early-stage production this quarter.  \n\nWhile I believe the article is a little outdate in the \"90% complete\" statement, it is still very close to 100% completion (outside of the purification circuit elements).\n\nWe must remember production this quarter will be in small quantities and unpurified as the purification circuit elements are not slated to be finished until Q1'23.\n\nThereafter, CO will continue ramp up in production over the next couple of quarters.\n\nAs soon as that is completed, we can likely expect State 2 construction (for an additional at least 20k tonnes/year of Lithium Carbonate) to begin.\n\nMost notable in the article above: \"According to the report, purchase agreements at current market prices are in place for more than 80% of Lithium America’s participation in the planned production of stage 1.\"\n\nWe should remember that current market prices are well in excess the feasibility study prices originally planned.  Estimates, based on the latest quarter of public filings indicate prices significantly north of $30k/tonne.   This will mean outsized cash flows for CO for some time to come which will improve the IRR and NPV by orders of magnitude.\n\nWe also need to remember that LAC and Ganfeng are effective \"lenders\" to the project and will be paid back first before funds go to the local government for their 8.5% share (which should be viewed almost as a royalty).\n\nAll in all, LAC is in an amazing position now to reap significant cash flows from its flagship asset in Argentina and will have more than enough capital to fund development of its 100% owned Pastos Grandes project in conjunction with 17.4% owned Arena Minerals (in conjunction with Ganfeng).  In June 2022, LAC had approved a development plan and budget of \\~$30 million to advance Pastos Grandes towards a  construction decision which we expect an resolution shortly.\n\nHope that helps,\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

    "selftext": "The following article further below was published on the Deep Dive on December 11, 2022:\n\nThe article's reference is to Judge Du's recent filing, which had the following excerpts:\n\n1. In the final paragraph of her filing, and in regards to the Environmental Plaintiffs claim, the Court is interested in the extent to which \"**Ctr for Biological Diversity vs. United States Fish & Wildlife Serv. 33 F.4th 1202 (9th Cir. 2022)\" controls the outcome** of this case.\n2. The Court expects the **parties to be prepared to address the scope of any relief that may be appropriate were the Court to agree with Environmental Plaintiff's argument based on that case and remand it back to the BLM**.\n\nThis last sentence is the only request on an argument made by Judge Du in regards to the case and seems to indicate that the court may be leaning towards remanding the case back to the BLM (although it is unclear if it will be a remand with vacature, with injunction, or with neither which may be why she is asking what relief is being suggested by the parties).\n\nThe implications are discussed in our prior reddit post in the link below:\n\n[www.reddit.com/r/LithiumAmerica/comments/zdd6g8/latest\\_filing\\_from\\_judge\\_du\\_indicates\\_potential/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LithiumAmerica/comments/zdd6g8/latest_filing_from_judge_du_indicates_potential/)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n[thedeepdive.ca/federal-judges-comments-increase-skepticism-that-lithium-americas-nevada-lithium-project-will-get-off-the-ground/](https://thedeepdive.ca/federal-judges-comments-increase-skepticism-that-lithium-americas-nevada-lithium-project-will-get-off-the-ground/)\n\n# Lithium Americas: Judge Pours Cold Water on Nevada Project\n\n# Federal Judge’s Comments Increase Skepticism That Lithium Americas’ Nevada Lithium Project Will Get Off the Ground\n\nBy [Jim McFadden](https://thedeepdive.ca/author/jim-mcfadden/)\n\nOn December 2, Chief Judge Miranda Du of the U.S. District Court of the District of Nevada appeared to throw some additional cold water on ***Lithium Americas’ (TSX: LAC)*** Thacker Pass lithium project in the state.  Various environmental groups have [appealed the January 2021](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/video/construction-on-thacker-pass-can-t-start-until-appeal-is-cleared-lithium-americas-ceo~2251549) decision by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management that had approved the project.\n\n[In Friday’s court filing](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3913974-lithium-americas-falls-amid-judges-questions-before-january-thacker-pass-hearing), Judge Du advised the attorneys on the case to be prepared to address the relevance of two separate federal courts’ decisions to overturn the U.S. Forest Service’s 2017 approval of the Rosemont copper project in Arizona.  Not surprisingly, Hudbay Minerals’ proposed open-pit copper mine has never produced one ounce of copper.  Ominously, Judge Du wants to discuss whether the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals’ May 2022 Rosemont ruling “controls the outcome of this \\[Thacker Pass\\] case.”\n\nIn early October, [Judge Du had ordered oral hearings ](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3889448-judge-sets-hearing-in-thacker-pass-lithium-mine-case-for-january)on the Thacker Pass case to take place on January 5, 2023.  It follows that the Federal Court will not rule on the case until early 2023 at the earliest.  Briefings on the matter concluded in mid-August 2022.  The timing of the oral hearing, and the likely timing of issuance of a final decision, were several months later than expected.\n\nQuite logically, Lithium Americas will not make a final construction decision until it receives Judge Du’s ruling, but the tea leaves look less constructive in light of Judge Du’s December 2 comments.  The judge’s ruling is the final regulatory hurdle standing in the way of the commencement of construction.  \n\nLithium Americas owns a 100% stake in Thacker Pass.  The property may have sufficient resources to produce 60,000 tonnes of battery-grade lithium carbonate per year for 40 years.\n\n## The Company’s Crown Jewel Remains the Cauchari-Olaroz lithium brine project in Argentina\n\nWhile this Thacker Pass news cannot be considered a positive, Lithium Americas’ valuation is much more tied to its key asset — the flagship Cauchari-Olaroz lithium brine project in Argentina.  Lithium Americas expects early-stage Cauchari production will begin later this month.\n\nLithium Americas owns 49% of Cauchari and China’s largest lithium company, Ganfeng Lithium, owns the balance, or 51%.  Lithium Americas will operate the mine.  Offtake agreements at market prices (which are very attractive) are in place for over 80% of Cauchari’s planned Stage 1 production.\n\nWhen Cauchari commences production, Lithium America’s portion of the cash flow could be quite substantial.  According to a Feasibility Study and Mineral Reserve Estimate with an effective date of September 30, 2020, the project could produce 40,000 tonnes of battery-grade lithium carbonate for 40 years.\n\n[*READ: Lithium Americas To Split Into Two Firms To Unlock Shareholder Value*](https://thedeepdive.ca/lithium-americas-to-split-into-two-firms-to-unlock-shareholder-value/)\n\nBased on assumptions of long-term lithium carbonate prices and operating costs of US$12,000 per tonne and US$3,600 per tonne, respectively, the project could generate an average EBITDA of around US$300 million per year.  However, since lithium carbonate delivered to China currently trades in the vicinity of US$80,000 per tonne, Cauchari’s annual cash flow could potentially be multiples of US$300 million.  \"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free

Speaking at this year’s Lithium Update by the Experts put on by Latin Resources at Perth’s Hyatt Hotel, Lowry dubbed lithium the “irreplaceable element” in the new energy transition and says the balance of power in the industry has switched from China to Australia and South America.\n\nLithium Carbonate prices were cellar dwelling at just over US$10,000 per tonne back in 2019 however have hit highs of around US$80,000 per tonne more recently with the battery chemical’s price graph showing a remarkable hockey stick curve over the last 3 years. **Whilst the US$97,000 tag is the peak price predicted by Lowry, the Global Lithium LLC founder has identified a base value of just below $US80,000 and a potential 2027 low of around $US70,000**.\n\nThe greater **international focus on lithium-ion batteries for both electric vehicles and mobile devices over the past five years has created a demand that far outweighs current and projected supply.**\n\nWhilst mineral heavyweights in North America and Europe are busy exploring – and finding — large lithium deposits in their respective regions, Lowry believes the **most positive timeline for these resources to reach production is at least five years away**.\n\nThe “Lithium Triangle” of Chile, Argentina and Bolivia currently produces about 35 to 40 per cent of global lithium supply, mainly from the three nations’ lithium “brine” production. The majority of **production has come from four major projects in Argentina and Chile that Lowry says have seen slow growth over the past decade.**\n\nHowever a host of new projects are scheduled to begin operations between next year and 2030 and are predicted to significantly boost lithium production in the region.\n\nWhilst the **upcoming projects will need time to ramp up and are likely to require about 10 years to reach steady state production levels**, the South American lithium industry continues to operate at a strong and steady pace.\n\nAustralia currently contributes around 45 per cent of the global market through its massive hard rock spodumene resources with the Greenbushes deposit in the South West region of Western Australia still accounting for the majority of current supply. Australia has also seen massive growth in its lithium industry over the past five years but unlike its Lithium Triangle peers Australia is all about hard rock mineral deposits – not watery brines.\n\nMajor operations such as Pilbara Minerals’ Pilgangoora deposit and Mineral Resources’ Mt Marion operation have been exporting spodumene concentrate for a number of years and have an established supply chain to the international market. **Australia has also seen a number of major lithium players develop lithium hydroxide processing plants as the industry starts to wake up to the exponential margins enjoyed by the downstream players**.\n\nLowry predicts the **current global lithium supply deficit to continue for some years** and whilst there has been **significant growth in potential supply with numerous projects being unlocked all over the world, demand is still growing faster**.\n\nMajor original equipment manufacturers such as **automotive manufactuers are now inking their own deals with potential lithium suppliers**. In February Western Australia’s Liontown Resources signed a five-year offtake agreement with Tesla to supply lithium concentrate from its Kathleen Valley lithium mine near Leinster in the northern Goldfields region of Western Australia. The deal became a binding offtake agreement in June with Liontown agreeing to provide 100,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate in the first year of production before rising to 150,000 tonnes for the next four years. Liontown has a similar deal in place with American car giant Ford. Kathleen Valley is forecast to produce about 500,000 tonnes of spodumene concentrate in its first year, expanding to about 700,000tpa over a 23-year mine life.\n\nSome Chinese companies are also looking to secure lithium too. Askari Metals recently signed a strategic agreement with Shanghai-listed Zhejiang Kanglongda Special Protection Technology. The Chinese heavyweight will assist Askari with lithium chemical downstream processing techniques and opportunities in addition to providing access to capital for future development. As part of the alliance Zhejiang Kanglongda will be provided with a preferred offtake position at market prices. The agreement relates to Askari’s lithium-stacked portfolio including a trio of projects in WA’s eastern Pilbara region and a single project in the Northern Territory.\n\nLatin Resources is hoping to bring Brazil into the Lithium Triangle with its Salinas project. The company’s wholly owned subsidiary Belo Lithium holds more than 6000 hectares in the spodumene rich district of Minas Gerais and is currently undertaking resource definition drilling at its Colina prospect where a number of hits have been recorded above 1 per cent lithium oxide including a peak grade of 3.22 per cent. Latin’s market cap has hiked from around $6m in 2019 to over $200m as the market switches on to the quality of its assets.\n\nIn North America former Pilbara Minerals Managing Director Ken Brinsden, another presenter at the recent lithium forum, has taken on the role of Chairman of TSXV listed – and soon to be ASX listed - Patriot Battery Metals. The company is busy exploring its Corvette project near James Bay in Canada where it has identified more than 70 lithium pegmatite outcrops along a 50km trend. The explorer has recorded some eye-watering drill hits including an 86.2m intercept going more than 2 per cent lithium oxide, in addition to a whopping 159.7m section at 1.65 per cent lithium oxide.\n\nExploration in Europe is also heating up and that message was not lost on the attendees at the Lithium update when European Metals’ Keith Coughlan took the podium. The company’s Cinovec project is understood to host the largest lithium resource in Europe whilst Infinity Lithium is working to develop the second largest resource at its San José lithium project near Cáceres in Spain. San José boasts a 111 million-tonne resource going 0.61 per cent lithium oxide. Cinovec has a JORC-compliant resource of 708 million tonnes at an average grade of 0.42 per cent lithium oxide.\n\nInterestingly Infinity is one of a number of players now planning to build a lithium hydroxide plant alongside its mine.\n\nWhilst some market analysts suggest the upcoming supply will exceed the future demand for lithium, **Lowry predicts a continued growth into 2035 as the global appetite for lithium-ion batteries continues to feed the new energy revolution**.\n\nNotably Lowry says Western Australia is now the unofficial number one lithium jurisdiction in the world.\n\nIts lithium endowment continues to grow and unlike some other mineral rich jurisdictions around the world that are yet to turn out a tonne of spodumene, Western Australia is actually mining it.\n\nWith the automotive industry junking fossil fuelled cars at pace in favour of lithium driven models, lithium is set to be the “new oil” – and Western Australia in particular is set to enjoy a white knuckle ride the likes of which has not been seen since oil was discovered in Texas all those years ago.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nGoldman

producer, expects prices for the battery metal to stay high into 2023 on the back of soaring demand boosted by strong sales of electric vehicles (EVs) in China.\n\n📷\n\nIn its [results for the the three months to September 30](https://s25.q4cdn.com/757756353/files/doc_news/2022/11/PR_3Q22_ing_FINAL.pdf), the miner announced record lithium sales, which more than quadrupled in the quarter from a year ago. \n\n## The company’s highest quarterly sales, combined with above-average lithium prices, helped it achieve a net profit of $1.1 billion in the period. \n\nRevenue surged more than four times year-on-year to $2.95 billion, with lithium revenues growing more than 12 times.\n\n**Prices for the battery metal jumped to record levels during Q3 at more than $56,000 per tonne**, it said.\n\nDespite market [fears over a possible cooling-off](https://www.mining.com/web/commodity-star-lithium-shows-signs-of-cooling-after-1200-rally/) of China’s two-year lithium buying spree, SQM remains bullish on the long-term outlook.\n\nThe Santiago-based miner **forecast global lithium demand to grow this year by at least 40% thanks to rising EVs sales in China**, which it estimates will exceed 6.5 million units — double last year’s amount.\n\n“On top of the strong demand growth, similar to what we have seen in the past, **new lithium supply outside of SQM has been delayed and slow to come online**,” the company said.\n\nThat **will keep the market tight and means “this high-priced environment could continue for the remainder of 2022 and into 2023**.”\n\n**Albemarle (NYSE: ALB), the world’s top lithium producer, also reported a surge in sales** [**earlier this month**](https://www.mining.com/web/albemarle-swings-to-quarterly-profit-on-surging-lithium-demand/)**.**\n\nBoth companies are the only two producing the battery metal in Chile’s Atacama region, which supplies nearly one-quarter of the globe’s lithium.\n\nThe copper-rich country currently generates about 29% of the world’s supply, but it plans to double production by 2025 to about 250,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nRK

Bearish Calls from Banks — Is it a Buying Opportunity?](https://investingnews.com/lithium-stocks-fall-banks-bearish/)\n\nLithium stocks are under pressure this week on the back of new commentary from Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse.\n\n**Shares of lithium companies around the world have been on a downward spiral this week, tumbling after bearish calls from major banks fueled worries about supply for the key** [**battery metal**](https://investingnews.com/category/daily/resource-investing/battery-metals-investing/)**.**\n\nLast week, investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:[GS](https://investingnews.com/stock-information?symbol=gs:us)) reiterated its outlook for the lithium market, saying that \"overcapacity and slowing (electric vehicle) sales\" should put downward pressure on lithium prices next year.\n\nThe call follows the bank's June prediction for oversupply in the lithium market, which most [lithium analysts disagreed with](https://investingnews.com/experts-goldman-sachs-lithium-oversupply/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20report%20misses%20market,of%20the%20battery%20metals%20market.). Although it still expects lower prices, Goldman Sachs has now revised its forecast for supply, **predicting an 84,000 tonne deficit this year compared to its previous forecast of an 8,000 tonne surplus. The bank also changed its outlook for next year, and is now expecting a small surplus compared to the 76,000 tonne surplus it previously called for**.\n\nMeanwhile, **Credit Suisse (NYSE:**[**CS**](https://investingnews.com/stock-information?symbol=cs:us)**) said Wuxi** [**lithium carbonate**](https://investingnews.com/daily/resource-investing/battery-metals-investing/lithium-investing/lithium-carbonate-lithium-hydroxide-nemaska-lithium/) **futures were down on “speculation in China that a major cathode producer might have slashed production targets and some Chinese firms forecasting softening in the market later in 2023.**”\n\nAs a result of the banks' commentary, [top lithium producer](https://investingnews.com/daily/resource-investing/battery-metals-investing/lithium-investing/top-lithium-producers/) Albemarle (NYSE:[ALB](https://investingnews.com/stock-information?symbol=alb)), which operates [brines](https://investingnews.com/daily/resource-investing/battery-metals-investing/lithium-investing/lithium-deposit-types-brine-pegmatite-and-sedimentary/) in Chile’s Atacama desert, saw its share price fall more than 8 percent; rival SQM (NYSE:[SQM](https://investingnews.com/stock-information?symbol=sqm)), which also has operations in the South American country, was down more than 3 percent when markets opened, while Argentina-focused Livent (NYSE:[LTHM](https://investingnews.com/stock-information?symbol=lthm)) plummeted almost 6 percent.\n\nAustralian lithium producers were also hit hard this week, with Perth-based Pilbara Minerals (ASX:[PLS](https://investingnews.com/stock-information?symbol=pls:au),OTC Pink:PILBF) down almost 12 percent. Mineral Resources (ASX:[MIN](https://investingnews.com/stock-information?symbol=min:au),OTC Pink:MALRF), which is also a big producer of [iron](https://investingnews.com/category/daily/resource-investing/base-metals-investing/iron-investing/) ore, fell 5 percent, and Allkem (ASX:[AKE](https://investingnews.com/stock-information?symbol=ake:au),OTC Pink:OROCF), which operates the Salar de Olaroz in Argentina, saw the biggest loss at almost 14 percent.\n\n**Despite those declines, experts continue to emphasize lithium's positive long-term outlook.**\n\n“**I'm reiterating the issues I have with the (previous) Goldman Sachs report (and) the new version of the report,” Rodney Hooper of RK Equity** told the Investing News Network (INN) on the sidelines of this year’s Benchmark Week event.\n\n“The first thing is, and I keep repeating it, **lithium production does not mean battery-grade supply, they're two separate things. Qualification timelines are still tough. Everything that's produced is not qualifying into the supply chain,”** he said.\n\n**RK Equity’s battery-grade demand number is 40,000 tonnes more than Goldman Sachs’ forecast for 2022**, with **actual restocking of battery-grade material in 2022 being much lower** than the bank’s numbers.\n\n**Hooper said he expects the lithium market to have a shortfall as big as this year, if not bigger, in 2023, with prices holding at US$65,000 to US$70,000 per tonne and staying at high levels until at least mid-decade.**\n\nLithium juniors were not exempt from the selloff this week, which raises the question of whether this is a buying opportunity for investors interested in the lithium space.\n\n“Lithium shares have run, so one needs to be selective,” Hooper told INN. “But I do see the market price holding for some time, which means that anything coming into production in the next while is going to enjoy high prices.”\n\nHooper believes there’s still value to be found in some early stage companies.\n\n“I still think that early stage companies that can drill up have a lot of opportunity if we’re going to see elevated prices for most of this decade, which a lot of us believe that you will, and not necessarily at these levels, but high enough to be very profitable and well above what's priced into the market,” he said.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n[https://www.marketindex.com.au/news/lithium-market-to-remain-in-deficit-despite-supply-efforts-and-price](https://www.marketindex.com.au/news/lithium-market-to-remain-in-deficit-despite-supply-efforts-and-price)\n\n \n\n# Lithium market to remain in deficit despite supply efforts and price volatility: Macquarie\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sulnugyjzu0a1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb29d356997e5824c4bcc42a7c0c3c0e3a4898d8\n\n \n\n### KEY POINTS\n\n* Macquarie expects the lithium market to remain in deficit through to 2030\n* Lithium carbonate futures on the Wuxi Exchange fell -7% on Monday but stabilised the next day, up \\~1%\n* Macquarie remains outperform on all lithium stocks under its coverage, except Core Lithium\n\n \n\nMacquarie said lithium supply remains tight at each key component of the EV battery supply chain despite the recent volatility in lithium carbonate prices in China.\n\n\"Despite near-term future price volatility, we believe buoyant lithium prices present potential for valuation upside to all lithium names under our coverage universe,\" Macquarie analysts said in a note on Wednesday.\n\nLithium carbonate futures on the Wuxi Stainless Steel Exchange fell around -7% on Monday amid speculation that a major Chinese cathode producer slashed its production targets, a potential red flag for softening demand for the battery metal.\n\n## Supply remains tight\n\nShanghai Metals Market's lithium carbonate inventory data, which covers an extensive 30 lithium refiners and more than 70 cathode makers in China, showed that lithium carbonate inventories continued to decline in October, according to Macquarie.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qsu7nphpzu0a1.png?width=1383&format=png&auto=webp&s=90aaa0bc001b512b396649d2bc22ed1407dae886\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nThe analysts pointed out that Wuxi lithium carbonate prices stabilised on Tuesday, trading 1% higher than where it closed on Monday.\n\n## No deficit in sight\n\nMacquarie reaffirmed its view that the lithium market will remain in a deficit despite ongoing supply efforts.\n\n\"While most lithium companies have upgraded their near-term growth outlooks, we highlight that the actual output in the September quarter was mixed, with misses in production and delays in project commissioning,\" the analysts said.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bu0uk7rrzu0a1.png?width=1310&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3f73b055773d9107b8c88d1b2780ddda98339f5\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nIn the end, I place my faith and research on industry professionals (e.g., Benchmark, Joe Lowry, RK Equity) who dedicate their careers to understanding Lithium (and not paid securities analysts who have little to no background in the sector).\n\nOn the spot markets we continue to witness record highs:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sh05txecpr0a1.png?width=888&format=png&auto=webp&s=985fc9828292cd2ca818a21708cc6e6ffc34cec0\n\nThe latest quarterly reportings from Allkem, SQM and Albermarle indicate contract pricing at above $50k/tonne.\n\nCauchari-Olaroz is expected to begin first production (Technical Grade) this quarter with first sales in Q1'23.

    "title": "LITHIUM: Morgan Stanley vs. Morningstar Smackdown - who do you believe?",
    "selftext": "Yesterday, we saw the lithium sector get hit across the board (disproportionately so relative to the market doldrums).\n\nIn large part, this was due to a Morgan Stanley statement that they had observed a 'large fall' in lithium exports and prices from one of the world's largest producers - Sociedad Química y Minera (SQM).\n\n[Lithium stocks tumble after Morgan Stanley flags fall in both price and exports (marketindex.com.au)](https://www.marketindex.com.au/news/lithium-stocks-tumble-after-morgan-stanley-flags-fall-in-both-price-and)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/870t6yzv6ot91.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6ac1ea33d2af0584d8367a0d0e66d12ff6d6ae4\n\nNow, MS caveated this by saying \"part of the decline could be explained by product mix.\"\n\nThis means the \"price and volume decline could just be an anomaly arising from 'a particular shipment and maybe by the additional lithium sulphate sent to their new the hydroxide plant in China.' \"\n\nThis \"De ja vu\" moment had hints of the prior Goldman Sachs prognostications of doom and gloom and the lithium market peer group fell in line.\n\nOn the other hand, Morningstar Lithium Analyst Seth Goldstein issued a counterbalancing statement:\n\n**Lithium Stocks Fall on Broker Warning of Lower Prices; We Disagree and View Selloff as Opportunity**\n\n\" On Oct. 12, lithium stocks plummeted on a broker's note warning of lower lithium prices for Sociedad Quimica y Minera in September and reiterating a forecast for lithium prices to fall in 2023. After reviewing the note, we see no reason to change our outlook. Accordingly, we maintain our $350 per share fair value estimate for narrow-moat Albemarle, $65 (CAD 83) per share fair value estimate for no\u0002moat Lithium Americas, $40 per share fair value estimate for narrow-moat Livent, and $120 per share fair value estimate for narrow-moat Sociedad Quimica y Minera.\n\nWe view the selloff as an opportunity for investors to pick up high-quality lithium producers at a good discount. **Our top pick remains Lithium Americas. The stock trades in 5-star territory as we think the market forecasts lower lithium prices and low long-term volumes from the company's three resources. Though the company currently produces no lithium, its first project is set to enter production by the end of the year.**\n\nFor investors who prefer lithium producers who are already operating, Albemarle, Livent, and Sociedad Quimica y Minera all trade in 4-star territory and we view all three stock as undervalued. We think the market is forecasting lithium spot prices, which are currently around $74,000 per metric ton for carbonate, will fall materially in 2023 as new supply enters the market. However, we point to strong demand growth from increased EV sales as the driver that will keep prices high.\n\nWe continue to forecast lithium prices will average $70,000 per metric ton in 2023. For low-cost lithium producers, this should lead to higher average realized prices in 2023 as there is somewhat of a lag between spot prices and realized contract price, that varies based on producer pricing strategy.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/llegforx8ot91.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4122d3985faceaa386d4b569846d013c00be7de\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xw87hf619ot91.png?width=747&format=png&auto=webp&s=a601899289d5c20b74016138da776aeb4dda3078\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nFrom the above, you can see that LAC remains Morningstar's top Lithium pick and I suspect LAC share prices will continue to elevate further as we converge on the January 5th hearing.\n\nBenchmark's latest pricing estimates and forecasts seem to support Morningstar's Analyst's view:\n\n[twitter.com/daisy\\_benchmark/status/1580540511219511296](https://twitter.com/daisy_benchmark/status/1580540511219511296)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fg2tfc4tiot91.png?width=675&format=png&auto=webp&s=be4ca283ac32c27551a1d03a0302f3437d5badc1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, it is not realistic to think that the off-take agreements would match the chinese spot prices.  Jonathan Evans has warned as such and indicated in various interviews that the ranges earlier in the year that he was seeing were $20k to $25k per tonne, than progressed to statements referencing $25k to $30k, and most recently hinting at pricing above $30k per tonne.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the demand side, forecasts continue to point to a supply-demand gap which will not be remediated until well after 2030 (with 2050 estimated to require 20x the amount of Lithium being produced today).\n\nThe latest Benchmark lithium forecasts from earlier today validate that belief:\n\n[twitter.com/benchmarkmin/status/1580577735986262018](https://twitter.com/benchmarkmin/status/1580577735986262018)\n\n[Lithium has to scale twenty times by 2050 as automakers face generational challenge | Benchmark (benchmarkminerals.com)](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/membership/lithium-has-to-scale-twenty-times-by-2050-as-automakers-face-generational-challenge/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ngv0wj8rhot91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2db37009f9ad099efff44e9fd21fb15e0d472dbd\n\nOur own estimations for the off-take agreements LAC will be entering into (for CO) will be in the $25k to $30k per tonne range.\n\nThe following was provided from information from another board:\n\nIt's important to recollect that in 2018 Morgan Stanley claimed gloom and doom for the sector before and was proven drastically wrong:\n\n\"[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/morgan-stanley-claims-lithium-price-plunge-45-2021-power-more/?articleId=6375049628567502848](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/morgan-stanley-claims-lithium-price-plunge-45-2021-power-more/?articleId=6375049628567502848)\n\n\"In a research report published this week, the bank predicts the current growth of electric car sales to undershoot current expectations, thereby stoking fears that previous lithium supply shortages will become a redundancy and possibly leaving stockpiles of the metal unsold.\n\nOne of the major takeaways from the report, is that Morgan Stanley stipulates a required rate of 31% of all new cars sold being of the electric variety, for the current rate of lithium supply to balance with demand.\n\nThe bank says the current rate of new electric cars sold is only around 2% and would have to rise significantly to at least 31% by the year 2025 to “clear the market.\n\n”Morgan Stanley’s research directly contradicts consensus analyst estimates of a lithium supply shortage, but despite its minority-held view, markets reacted negatively to the controversial research report.\n\nPrognostication of the future of the lithium market has not been one of Morgan Stanley's strong points in the past.  I don't see much reason to suggest that the leopard has changed its spots here in 2022 over and above how spotted it was back in 2018.\"\n\nBelow is a copy of a separate report from Morgan Stanley on their forecasts for Lithium:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a1k1511ow6v91.png?width=923&format=png&auto=webp&s=922cc51f0c5276ae4ac915649b8a2045567da156\n\nIf you trust their own models, there will be a significant Demand supply gap particularly when Thacker Pass is scheduled to begin production.\n\nWe hope those perspectives help,\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

    "selftext": "In a previous post and in my prior stock talks on Lithium Americas, I have mentioned the Lassonde curve as a means of gauging approximate value for the various resources/deposits/projects that LAC has in its portfolio.  A detailed description of the Lassonde curve can be found here:\n\n[New Age Metals and the Lassonde Curve – New Age Metals Inc.](https://newagemetals.com/new-age-metals-and-the-lassonde-curve/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/higft46p92r91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e918a386c0218cd42cf2b3f2bd91b71efad495d\n\nI was happy to come across an author, \"Roy K\" from another blog site who had read one of my posts and took it upon himself to accurately draw/overlay a depiction of Lithium Americas' various assets and their relative stages on the Lassonde Curve:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0j3hdbaa82r91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=547647500c722e4ca59b872b78289fe5cb7b93c6\n\nIn his post, he wrote:\n\n\" I was recently reminded of the Lassonde Curve, which tracks the value of a junior mining project through to development. I just posted a photo under the Photos tab showing how I would plot LAC's various projects along the curve. \n\nThe projects I've identified are Cauchari phases 1 & 2, Thacker Pass phases 1 & 2, Pastos Grande (formerly Millennial), Arena's Sal de la Puna (LAC 17% ownership of Arena), and GT1's Seymour project (LAC 5% ownership of GT1). \n\nMy plotting is highly subjective, I know, but I tried to place the younger projects in relation to when I see them entering the PEA and Engineering stages. I think I had the most difficulty with Cauchari Phase 2 because it's well along in it's engineering, but I'm not sure a PEA/PFS has been published. It appears the FS from 2020 only covers Phase 1. \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would also add some clarification:\n\n1. The Y-axis is not the value of the company or share price, it is the \"change in value\" contribution from each progression step along the X-axes.  In other words, as an example, the Exploration and Development stage (e.g., Financing) and to some extent the Production stage, have the largest contributions to the value increases to a mining company over the shortest time on average.\n2. Another way to think about it is that the proportional length of the curve to the right of each project represents the % of the total NPV of the project yet remaining to be realized, and the proportional length to the left of the project represents the value of the NPV that the project should have already realized.\n\nRoy does an excellent job of illustrating and positioning the stages of LAC's various projects.\n\nOne simple valuation methodology is to identify the appropriate NPV and discount rate for each project as found under most PEA/PFS/FS/DFS reports (note: you must select what discount rate/cost of capital would be appropriate for each project based on the funding sources of the company) where available for each resource/deposit/project and come up with an overall enterprise value estimate.\n\nWhat is most interesting to me though is that, assuming Thacker Pass is approved by Judge Du, it is apparent that the DOE will provide substantially all the funding for Thacker Pass Phase I project right away (and likely the Phase II project, and possibly even the GT1 Seymour project).  As I noted in a prior post:\n\n[www.reddit.com/r/LithiumAmerica/comments/xqtm8t/controversy\\_over\\_lac\\_indicates\\_doe\\_loan\\_for\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LithiumAmerica/comments/xqtm8t/controversy_over_lac_indicates_doe_loan_for_the/)\n\n\" As part of the process, LAC is most likely at the end of phase 3: the \"Due Diligence & Negotiation phase\" (which was originally begun 6 months ago) and will likely get to a \"conditional commitment offer\" at the end or may already have it in place. My guess, they parallel tracked the negotiation of loan documents in anticipation of Judge Du's decision and are now in a holding pattern waiting on Judge Du's decision. I expect the loan approval will be announced in Q4'22 along with the spin-off/divestiture/separation of the North American and South American assets. \"\n\nThis would catapult and capture all of that NPV value in Stage 4 (at the lowest cost of capital due to the low cost funding from the DOE) for Thacker Pass Phase 1 almost immediately.  More amazing is that LAC will be able to do this without any dilution (a rarity for junior and major mining companies).\n\nThis would also likely be true for Thacker Pass Phase II (as the DOE has historically provided additional funding as needed for projects under similar loan programs) and possibly GT1 (although I am not clear if the DOE would fund a project that is not domiciled in the US even though it is a North American free trade partner).\n\nWith Thacker Pass having the majority of the NPV for all the projects combined, a Judge Du approval, DFS update, Stage 1 production start,  Announcement of the Cauchari-Offtake Agreement and a confirmation on funding the majority of TP with a DOE loan would result in a significant capture from Stage 3 of the Lassonde Curve.\n\nIn my opinion, based on my own models, the completion of all parts should more than double the current value of the company by end of year.\n\nOf course there is no guarantee that all parts will materialize, but I believe the indications point heavily in that direction.\n\nI hope this helps all you LAC investors and potential investors and a thanks to \"Roy K\" for crafting a great visual of what I had only expressed verbally and in writing.\n\nGLTA,\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to\n\n1.

    "selftext": "Morningstar Equity Analyst, Seth Goldstein, issued his analyst report for Lithium Americas today  with a **$65 USD price target (10/7/22)** stating as follows:\n\n\" **No Changes to Our Outlook** as Thacker Pass Decision Delayed Until January; Shares Undervalued \"\n\n\" On Oct. 7, Lithium Americas announced its scheduled hearing for Jan. 5, 2023, regarding the appeal of its Record of Decision, or RoD, for Thacker Pass. The RoD is the final required document to successfully meet the Bureau of Land Management’s, or BLM, approval. Although we expected the RoD appeal to be finalized this fall, **we don’t see the delay causing material changes to the project status**. We continue to **forecast construction on the Thacker Pass project will begin early next year** as we think Lithium Americas is likely to receive project approval. With our outlook unchanged, we **maintain our fair value estimate of $65 (CAD 83) per share** and no-moat rating.\n\nShares were down nearly 10% at the time of writing on the news of the delay. At current prices, we view Lithium Americas shares as materially undervalued, trading at more than 60% below our fair value estimate. If Thacker Pass were to be denied and not allowed to move forward, **we would still value the Argentina assets at $25 per share**. With the stock trading just below $25 per share, we think **the bad news is priced in, offering investors a compelling opportunity**.\n\nThacker Pass would be the first large-scale lithium production resource in the U.S., with the **potential to produce 240,000 metric tons of lithium annually**. The project received its initial RoD in January 2021 but has subsequently faced legal challenges from environmental and native groups. In July, protest groups filed an appeal against Lithium America’s RoD on the basis that regional tribes were not adequately  consulted regarding the project development. Thacker Pass has r**eceived all additional local permits for water and land**. Additionally, the BLM analyzed the project site, **concluding that there was no archeological significance identified at Thacker Pass**. Based on our comparable projects analysis, **we think the RoD is likely to be upheld**. \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e9d1jtczmis91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ec7a8567dfff11d8af2e5899ab419c88686bf4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x8inb853nis91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fad13876368896d54b40400651e7af6a7f9c71f\n\nHope that helps,\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

    "selftext": " The following article of a an enivornmental issued related to a Lithium Mine and the endagerment of a Nevada Flow was published today:\n\n [Nevada flower listed as endangered at lithium mine site (kivitv.com)](https://www.kivitv.com/news/national/nevada-flower-listed-as-endangered-at-lithium-mine-site?_amp=true) \n\n# Nevada flower listed as endangered at lithium mine site\n\n By: The Associated Press*Posted at* *9:28 PM, Dec 14, 2022* *and last updated* *2022-12-14 23:28:31-05*\n\nRENO, Nev. (AP) — A Nevada wildflower was declared endangered at the only place it's known to exist — on a high-desert ridge where a lithium mine is planned to help meet growing demand for electric car batteries, U.S. wildlife officials announced Wednesday.\n\nThe Fish and Wildlife Service's formal listing of Tiehm's buckwheat and its accompanying designation of 910 acres (368 hectares) of critical habitat for the 6-inch-tall (15-centimeter-tall) flower with yellow blooms raises another potential hurdle for President Joe Biden's \"green energy\" agenda.\n\nWith an estimated remaining population of only about 16,000 plants, the service concluded that Tiehm's buckwheat is on the brink of extinction.\n\n\"We find that a threatened species status is not appropriate because the threats are severe and imminent, and Tiehm's buckwheat is in danger of extinction now, as opposed to likely to become endangered in the future,\" the agency said.\n\nThe proposed mining and mineral exploration poses the biggest threat to the flower. It's also threatened by road-building, livestock grazing, rodents that eat it, invasive plants and climate change, the service said. It said an apparent, unprecedented rodent attack wiped out about 60% of its estimated population in 2020.\n\nIoneer, the Australian mining company that's been planning for years to dig for lithium where the flower grows on federal land halfway between Reno and Las Vegas, says it has developed a protection plan that would allow the plant and the project to coexist.\n\n \n\nBut the listing under the Endangered Species Act subjects the mine to its most stringent regulatory requirement to date.\n\nIt also underscores the challenges facing the Biden administration in its efforts to combat climate change through an accelerated transition from fossil fuels to renewables.\n\n\"Lithium is an important part of our renewable energy transition, but it can't come at the cost of extinction,\" said Patrick Donnelly, Great Basin director for the Center for Biological Diversity, which petitioned for the listing in 2019 and sued last year to expedite the plant's protection.\n\nThe mining company said the decision \"provides further clarity for the path forward\" and is \"fully in line with Ioneer's expectations\" for development of the mine site at Rhyolite Ridge in the Silver Peak Range west of Tonopah, near the California border.\n\n\"We are committed to the protection and conservation of the species and have incorporated numerous measures into our current and future plans to ensure this occurs,\" Ioneer managing director Bernard Rowe said in a statement.\n\n\"Our operations have and will continue to avoid all Tiehm's buckwheat populations,\" he said.\n\n \n\nThe service's final listing rule will be published Thursday in the Federal Register.\n\nThe conservationists who sued to protect the plant insist that Ioneer's mitigation plan won't pass legal muster. They pledge to resume their court battle if necessary to protect the buckwheat's habitat from the rush to develop new lithium deposits.\n\nThe flowers are found on a total of just 10 acres (4 hectares) spread across about 3 square miles (7.8 square kilometers). Federal agencies are prohibited from approving any activity on federal lands that could destroy, modify or adversely affect any listed species' critical habitat.\n\nDonnelly said the company's latest operations plan for the first phase of the mine proposes avoiding a \"tiny island of land\" containing 75% of its population — surrounded by an open pit mine and tailings dumps within 12 feet (3.7 meters) of the flowers.\n\nThe Bureau of Land Management is reviewing the environmental impacts of Ioneer's latest operations and protection plans.\n\nBut Donnelley noted that USFWS estimated in Wednesday's final listing rule that the proposed scenario would \"disturb and remove up to 38% of the critical habitat for this species, impacting pollinator populations, altering hydrology, removing soil and risking subsidence.\"\n\n \n\n\"Ioneer's 'Buckwheat Island' scenario would spell doom for this sensitive little flower,\" Donnelly said.\n\nThe mine is among several renewable energy-related projects facing legal or regulatory challenges in Nevada. They include another lithium mine proposed near the Oregon border and a geothermal power plant where the Dixie Valley toad has been declared endangered in wetlands about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of Reno.\n\n\"Now that the buckwheat is protected, we'll use the full power of the Endangered Species Act to ensure Ioneer doesn't harm one hair on a buckwheat's head,\" Donnelly said.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n These kind of actions disturb me as it does not recognize the importance to the nation of developing its own lithium supply as a critical mineral for EV production.  Unfortunately, this is the kind of issue that can devastate projects like Lithium Americas Thacker Pass.\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

    "title": "Morningstar (10/27/22): Lithium Americas Should Benefit From Lithium Growth as Multiple Low-Cost Resources Enter Production",
    "selftext": "The following is from Morningstar Analyst Seth Goldstein:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Lithium Americas Should Benefit From Lithium Growth as Multiple Low-Cost Resources Enter Production**\n\n* **Business Strategy & Outlook**\n\nLithium Americas aims to become a low-cost pure-play lithium producer. The company has no current lithium sales volumes but is developing three resources that should eventually enter production, with the first project to enter production in early 2023. Cauchari-Olaroz and Pastos Grandes are brine resources located in northwestern Argentina. Thacker Pass is the company’s clay resource in the U.S. state of Nevada.\n\nAs electric vehicle adoption increases, we expect maintained double-digit annual growth for lithium demand. Lithium Americas should benefit as there should be more than enough demand for company’s three resources to enter production and expand capacity over time.\n\nAt Cauchari-Olaroz, Lithium Americas owns 44.8% of the project, while Ganfeng, one of the world’s largest lithium producers, owns 46.7%. The remaining 8.5% stake is owned by JEMSE, an Argentina state-owned mining company. Once Cauchari-Olaroz enters production and begins ramping up volumes, the project should have a similar cost position as other Argentinean brines, such as the resources of narrow-moat Livent and Orocobre. The project plans to bring an initial 40,000 metric tons of capacity later this year, with plans for additional expansions.\n\nLAC owns 100% of the Pastos Grandes project. Located close to the Cauchari-Olaroz project in Argentina, Pastos Grandes is currently under development. The project aims to produce 24,000 metric tons per year.\n\nLAC also owns 100% of the Thacker Pass resource. The project faces legal opposition from environmental groups that could cause delays, however, we think the project will eventually enter production. Thacker Pass would be the first clay-based lithium resource to enter production globally. Currently, all lithium is produced from either brine (primarily in South America) or hard rock mining that produces spodumene (primarily in Australia) Thacker Pass plans on bringing on an initial 40,000 metric tons of capacity, with additional expansion plans.\n\nLAC is considering separating the company into two businesses, based on geography. The argentina business would contain Cauchari-Olaroz and Pastos Grandes, while the U.S. business would contain Thacker Pass.\n\n**Bulls Say**\n\n* Through the ownership of three large lithium resources, Lithium Americas should be able to enter the lithium industry and become a major producer globally with one of the lowest-cost lithium carbonate resources and one of the largest rock-based resources globally.\n* As a lithium pure play, Lithium Americas is well positioned to increase profits from EV growth through lithium batteries.\n* Lithium prices will remain well above the marginal cost of production through at least the remainder of the decade, leading to excess profits and return on invested capital for Lithium Americas.\n\n**Bears Say**\n\n* Lithium Americas’ Thacker Pass operation will continue to face delays as activists fight to stop the project.\n* Lithium prices will fall as new supply comes online faster than demand, which will weigh on profitability. Lithium Americas' plans to develop three resources will prove value-destructive in the wake of lower prices.\n* Lithium Americas plans to produce lithium in Argentina, which exposes the company to the risk of increased taxes and royalties that will weigh on the company's profit\n\n**Economic Moat**\n\nWe assign Lithium Americas a no-moat rating. The company currently does not have any projects in production and is not generating revenue. However, we view the company's three lithium production resources as a having the potential to generate excess returns on invested capital due to low cost of production.\n\nGlobally, lithium has been produced from either the evaporation of brine or the mining of spodumene minerals. Lithium Americas, along with partner Ganfeng, is currently in construction phase of its lithium brine project in Cauchari-Olaroz in Argentina's Jujuy province. With aims of production in the early 2023, the Cauchari-Olaroz should have a similar cost position as other Argentinean brines, such as the resources of narrow-moat Livent and Orocobre.\n\nThe Cauchari-Olaroz project will pump brine from the underground aquifers above ground into reservoir\u0002like evaporation ponds to allow the brine to concentrate. With much of the water evaporated, the remaining salt can be processed into lithium derivatives, including lithium carbonate. In general, producing lithium carbonate from brines in Argentina costs less than when starting from spodumene or other brine resources with the exception of resources in Chile.\n\nWhile the Cauchari-Olaroz project will have lower concentration levels and less desirable climate conditions than those of Chilean peers, Argentinean lithium brines sit in the bottom quartile of the global lithium cost curve. Despite a higher cash production cost than its Chilean peers, Argentina-based producers benefit from lower total royalties and taxes. The lower total royalties have diminished much of the gap between Argentina and Chile lithium costs.\n\nWhile we see the potential for the Cauchari-Olaroz project to become a low-cost resource, we currently assign it a no moat rating as the project is not yet in production. Development studies indicate the project could warrant a moat based on the cost advantage moat source. However, these estimates could prove significantly different from actual production costs. Should the project ramp up production with a bottom quartile unit cost, we would revisit our moat rating.\n\nPastos Grandes is currently in development, and we forecast the project will begin operations in the late-2020s. The Pastos Grandes is located near Cauchari-Olaroz in Argentina and should have similar economics. We currently assign the project a no-moat rating, as the project is not in production, but plan to revisit once the company ramps up production\n\nLithium Americas' Thacker Pass project in the U.S. state of Nevada, which we project will begin operations in the mid-2020s. Thacker Pass aims to produce lithium from a clay resource. Currently, all global lithium is produced from brine or spodumene resources and a clay-based resource project has never entered production. Based on the company's plan, the clay production process will be similar to spodumene mining, where clay will be dug out of the ground in an open-pit mine and processed into lithium carbonate.\n\nThe lithium carbonate cost curve has traditionally been set by non-integrated producers who purchase and convert spodumene. Development studies indicate the potential for clay resources to be on the lower half of the cost curve. However, with no comparable resources, clay-based projects carry additional uncertainty as actual production costs could sit much higher on the cost curve. As a result, we see the threat of material value destruction should the project not be able to efficiently process clay into lithium chemicals, which precludes Lithium Americas from a narrow or wide moat rating.\n\nFurther, we see additional uncertainties around project timing, as Lithium Americas faces legal challenges to its permits from opposing activists. While we think Thacker Pass will ultimately be granted all required permits to begin construction, challenges could delay the project indefinitely. We view the potential of an indefinite delay as another threat of material value destruction that would prevent us from awarding Lithium Americas with a narrow or wide moat rating. As a result, we currently assign the Thacker Pass project with a no-moat rating. However, similar to views for the Cauchari-Olaroz and Pastos Grandes projects, we would revisit our moat rating should the project ramp up production with a low unit production cost.\n\n**Fair Value and Profit Drivers**\n\nOur fair value estimate is $65 per share. Our valuation will include all of Lithium Americas' assets until a spinoff of the U.S. business is formally announced.\n\nOur valuation assumes roughly an 11% weighted average cost of capital and includes a 1% equity risk premium related to the company’s lithium operations in Argentina, which could be subject to increased royalties. We value free cash flows generated beyond our 10-year explicit forecast horizon at a multiple of 11 times midcycle EBITDA.\n\nWe assume Lithium Americas will bring all three of its resources into production starting with the Cauchari-Olaroz project in early 2023. By the end of the decade, we assume the company will produce a little over 150,000 metric tons per year on a LCE basis. We forecast Cauchari-Olaroz will ramp up to 120,000 metric tons of capacity (including Ganfeng's share). We also assume the Thacker Pass project successfully resolves all court claims and moves forward. We forecast the project enters production by the middle of the decade eventually ramps up to 240,000 metric tons of capacity. We assume the Pastos Grandes project will ramp up to 24,000 metric tons of capacity, consistent with Millennial's plans before the acquisition.\n\nWe expect lithium carbonate prices (based on published indexes) will continue to rise in 2022, up from $16,400 per metric ton averaged in 2021. Spot prices as of late July 2022 were around $71,500 per metric ton. As demand growth outpaces supply, we expect lithium prices will remain well above our long-term forecast for lithium carbonate at $12,000 per metric ton through the rest of the decade. Based on our price elasticity analysis, we forecast prices will average $70,000 in 2023. We expect high-quality lithium hydroxide used in long-range batteries will continue to sell at a premium to carbonate, reflecting higher conversion costs.\n\nOur price forecast is based on our forecast for the marginal cost of lithium production on an all-in\u0002maintaining-cost basis. We expect lithium demand to grow at nearly a 20% annual rate from around 473,000 metric tons in 2021 to over 2.3 million metric tons by 2030. By 2030, over 90% of lithium demand will come from batteries that require high-quality lithium with few impurities. To meet demand, higher-cost supply will need to come on line from lower-quality resources that will require higher processing costs.\n\nOur base case assumes all three of Lithium Americas' project enter project. However, the Thacker Pass project is subject to a lawsuit challenging its federal permit. In a scenario where Thacker Pass does not move forward, our fair value estimate would fall to $25 per share.\n\nRisk and Uncertainty\n\nWe assign a Very High Morningstar Uncertainty Rating to Lithium Americas\n\nAs a pure-play lithium company with its first project set to begin production in 2023, project execution is the biggest risk facing Lithium Americas. This includes finishing construction on time and on budget, ramping up volumes, and producing battery quality product.\n\nOnce its projects enter production, volatility in lithium prices is another large risk. Lithium prices could decline if electric vehicle demand grows more slowly than expected. Electric vehicle demand could undershoot expectations if fuel cell technology were to overtake lithium as the dominant power source for next-generation vehicles. Additionally, lithium production could ramp up more quickly than demand warrants if too much supply enters the market. Further, new lithium production technologies could alter the supply curve. Additionally, Lithium Americas is also planning to make large investments to increase its carbonate production capacity, which brings execution risk and could result in cost overruns.\n\nFinally, Lithium Americas will produce lithium in Argentina. This exposes the company to the risk that the government may impose additional taxes that would greatly reduce profits. Given the significantly lower total tax and royalty rate in Argentina versus Chile, we think all lithium producers in Argentina face the risk of higher royalties, especially as President Alberto Fernandez campaigned on a populist platform.\n\nThe largest ESG risk comes from the potential that Lithium Americas’ Thacker Pass project does not receive permitting due to opposition from environmental groups. We see a moderate probability but a high materiality if this were to occur. Other risks come from potential emission reduction requirements. While we see this as having a moderate probability to occur, we see a low materiality as all lithium producers would be subject to the same requirements so the company could likely pass along these costs.\n\n**Capital Allocation**\n\nWe assign a Standard capital allocation to Lithium Americas based on our framework that assesses the balance sheet, investment decisions, and shareholder distributions.\n\nWe view Lithium Americas balance sheet as sound. The company currently has a clean balance sheet. Cash currently exceeds total debt on the balance sheet and should be enough to fund its portion of the remaining capital investments required for the Cauchari-Olaroz project to finish construction, enter production, and turn profitable. As a result, Lithium Americas should stay in a strong financial position.\n\nWe see management’s investment as fair. While none of its projects are in production, we believe Cauchari-Olaroz will likely fall on the low quartile of the global lithium cost curve and the investment will  be value-accretive. The project will come online at a good time, as growing EV adoption will drive lithium demand in excess of supply growth for at least the next several years. Further, we are in favor of the plan to eventually expand capacity at Cauchari-Olaroz. We think these investments will create significant shareholder value over the long run as this should maximize the value from Lithium Americas’ resource in Argentina.\n\nWe are also in favor of management’s development on the Thacker Pass project. While it would be first clay-based lithium resource globally, development studies indicate the project should operate well below marginal cost lithium producers. If the project successfully ramps up with costs near development study levels, we would be in favor of management’s plan to expand capacity at this site as well.\n\nAdditionally, we approve of Lithium Americas’ recent acquisition of the Pastos Grandes project in Argentina. We view the deal as value accretive to Lithium Americas. The project will likely have similar economics to Cauchari-Olaroz when it enters production in the late-2020s.\n\nFrom an execution standpoint, we rate the company neutral. So far, LAC has progressed on construction at Cauchari-Olaroz with its partner Ganfeng and has made progress in development work at Thacker Pass. However, our neutral rating is due to no project being in production yet. As management moves forward on its plans, we will adjust our rating accordingly. We view Lithium Americas partnership with Ganfeng at the Cauchari-Olaroz project as positive. Ganfeng is a leading global lithium producer, with experience in both upstream and downstream operations. While both companies are new to Argentina, we believe the experience will help the project successfully enter and ramp up production at a low unit cost.\n\nFinally, we think distributions are appropriate. The company does not pay a dividend and has no plans to repurchase shares, which makes sense for a company investing heavily in growth. Even after Lithium Americas brings its first project into production, we would prefer the company continue to invest in capacity expansions. Accordingly, we would not expect the company to pay a dividend or begin to repurchase shares, as we expect it will remain in growth mode, spending cash flow on lithium capacity expansions. We think this is the best use of capital and would expect this to remain the case for at least most of this decade.\n\nCEO and President Jonathan Evans was previously the vice president and general manager for the lithium division at FMC (which is now Livent) until 2013.

Evans also had executive management roles at Arysta LifeScience, AMRI, and General Electric.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe following are most notable takeaways and updaters:\n\n1. **Price Target:** Reiteration of $65 per share price target\n2. **CO Floor Value:** $25 / share (this echoes another analyst, where Cowen's Equity Analyst shared the same $25 minimum value of Cauchari-Olaroz).  Both analysts, and I concur, believe that LAC is trading at just the value of CO and does not ascribe any value for Thacker Pass, Pastos Grandes (purchased for $400MM), Optionality/Equity Investments in Arena Minerals ($15.7MM) or GT1 ($10MM in investments) or Ascend ($5MM) or the $392MM of cash and cash equivalents (or $360MM after the remaining CapEx has been spent).\n3. **Low Cost Producer:** Reiteration of Lithium Americas as being a low cost producer (1st quartile) and benefitting from a lower tax/royalty environment then Chile\n4. **TP Production Start Date:** Expectations for Thacker Pass to begin producing in the Mid-2020s (matching our own estimates for first production in 2026 with ramp-up throughout 2027)\n5. **Valuation Cost of Capital:**  Valuation assumes roughly an 11% weighted average cost of capital which we believe to be \"high\" if the DOE ATVM loan is approved.  Since the bulk of capital will be allocated to the development of Thacker Pass, and assuming Judge Du does affirm, the cost of capital will be significantly lower than 11% (as DOE ATVM loan reflect US treasury rates which range from 4% to 4.5% currently).  Given that there is likely a strategic partner (to fund the remaining capital costs alongside LAC's own cash balance sheet) in the wings that will be announced with the financing, we believe this creates significant upside to the $65/share valuation estimate done by the analyst.\n6. **Long Term Production Capacity:** By the end of the decade, the Morningstar Analyst estimates that CO will produce 150k tonnes per annum; TP will produce 240k tonnes per annum, and Pastos Grandes will produce 24k tonnes per annum.\n7. **RISKS:** **A.** Volatility in Lithium Prices based on Demand/Supply imbalances, **B.** New Disruptive Technology, **C.** Changes to Taxes/Royalties (particularly in Argentina), and the largest is D. TP approval by the courts.\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2. Share these posts with others to spread the word,\n3.

    "selftext": " [The Economist, 19Nov22, \"Another pot of white gold\", pp29-30](https://click.redditmail.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FLithiumAmerica%2Fcomments%2Fz16qrs%2Fargentina_could_help_the_world_by_becoming_a_big%2Fiy64xdk%2F%3F$deep_link=true%26correlation_id=f9f3ff87-fefb-47d8-ae52-85e34dc4aed5%26ref=email_post_reply%26ref_campaign=email_post_reply%26ref_source=email/2/01000184c0e4abfb-7477a17c-2263-42d8-8719-5c268b9771b3-000000/te1z8wWVzRhoIC4qMlx3cdjcyA0bQ7kIzYvF7gyG8Vs=276) \n\nArgentina could help the world by becoming a big lithium exporter\n\nPicture a country in South America that is pro-business, is attractive to foreign capital and offers political stability for long-term investment. Most people would think of Chile. But when it comes to mining lithium, a light, salt-like metal used for batteries in electric vehicles and mobile phones, the country in question is its [dysfunctional neighbour](https://archive.ph/o/Ad0JY/https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2022/10/13/sergio-massa-is-the-only-thing-standing-between-argentina-and-chaos), Argentina. Better known for triple-digit inflation and railing against the imf, Argentine officials have gone on a charm offensive from Washington to London with a boosterish message: the mining sector is open for business.\n\nThe transition to green energy has made lithium one of the world’s most sought-after metals. The price of lithium carbonate (lce), the raw material used in lithium-ion batteries, soared this year from a five-year average of around $14,000 per tonne to over $80,000. According to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a consultancy, as sales of electric vehicles grow, demand for lce is set to increase to 2.4m tonnes in 2030, compared with around 600,000 tonnes this year. Although lithium is plentiful, supply is struggling to keep up. Worldwide ten working mines can produce battery-grade lithium, says Daisy Jennings-Gray of Benchmark. A global scramble to find cheap deposits and to build mines to meet the increase in demand has started. Argentina could benefit.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of the world’s lithium can be found in the Andean plains that straddle Argentina, Chile and Bolivia—collectively known as the “lithium triangle”. Bolivia has the [world’s greatest resources](https://archive.ph/o/Ad0JY/https://www.economist.com/the-americas/how-bolivian-lithium-could-help-fight-climate-change/21806677), but it has failed to get production going. The state owns all lithium deposits and companies can exploit it only if they strike a deal with the public firm, Yacimientos de Litio Bolivianos. Political volatility and a lack of technical know-how have not helped. In 2016 the deputy interior minister was bludgeoned to death by miners.\n\nChile used to be the world’s lithium powerhouse. In 2017 it was overtaken by Australia, which became the top supplier globally. Chile now accounts for 26% of total supply. There, too, lithium deposits are owned by the state, which doles out contracts to private companies. Two firms, Albemarle and sqm, dominate the industry. In 2016 and 2018 the government renegotiated their contracts and introduced new rules that force companies to sell up to 25% of the metal at below-market prices at home in order to encourage local industry. In addition, royalties were linked to global prices, which can be volatile. Mining companies also agreed to give a portion of their earnings to development projects in the communities where they operate, in order to dampen protests by local activists and potentially create jobs. Although this is reasonable, it may have caused some investors to look across the Andes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ixm99rwfoc1a1.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=c49017a8e15aa3201085acd7debdcc15193337a5\n\nBy contrast lithium is not considered a strategic resource in Argentina. The state plays a small role. Instead, the constitution grants the country’s 23 provinces the right to administer minerals on their land and grant concessions to firms. A law from 1993 gives tax breaks for mining firms and establishes that their ventures cannot face new taxes for a period of 30 years from the date they present a feasibility study to the federal government. Royalties are capped at 3%, compared with 7-40% in Chile.All this has attracted capital. Some 40 lithium projects are currently in different stages of exploration, more than in any other country. JPMorgan Chase, a bank, expects Argentina to overtake Chile as the world’s second-largest producer by 2027. By 2030 Argentina could supply 16% of the world’s lithium, up from 6% in 2021 (see chart). Rio Tinto, an Anglo-Australian mining giant, acquired a lithium mine in March for $825m. posco, a South Korean firm, is investing $4bn in a lithium project.Chinese firms are especially keen. In July Ganfeng Lithium, a Chinese mega-producer, announced plans to buy a plant for almost $1bn. Argentina’s macroeconomic mismanagement—the country has around a dozen different exchange rates and inflation is nearing 100%—puts many Western companies off. For Chinese companies, however, “the point is less financial and more strategic,” says Carlos Freytes of Fundar, an Argentine think-tank. “It’s about a geopolitical ambition. They want to guarantee supply.” Of the nine projects closest to production in Argentina, six involve Chinese companies, according to data compiled by Fundar.Argentina’s mining laws were passed during a brief window of free-market reforms. They are difficult to change because the constitution devolves power to the provinces, which control the Senate. The governors of the three north-western provinces that host Argentina’s lithium—Salta, Catamarca, and Jujuy—are not afraid to push back against the government. When the foreign ministry said in October that it was in talks with Bolivia and Chile to create a “lithium opec” to set regional prices for the metal, the governors complained and the proposal stalled. They hope that foreign investment can help their provinces grow. The World Bank estimates that, in a best-case scenario, lithium production and processing could increase the gdp and fiscal revenue of those provinces by 10%.\n\nYet problems remain. Conflicts with indigenous communities who live on the land where lithium is extracted could grow. These have set back projects in Bolivia and Chile, and have shut down other mines in Argentina. A study from 2019 in Chile found that lithium mining worsened droughts in surrounding areas, which in turn angered locals. Argentina’s low royalty rates could mean that most of the profits end up in foreign pockets rather than state coffers, which might provoke a political backlash. “This is plunder, plain and simple,” says Enrique Viale, an environmental lawyer in Buenos Aires. On November 10th a law was discussed in the lower house of Congress that, if passed, could impose stricter environmental checks on wetlands, including the land on which lithium mines are built. The law was proposed a decade ago but foundered because of opposition by provinces and mining lobbies.\n\nAnd Argentina’s politicians could dampen investors’ enthusiasm. The state oil company has recently branched out into lithium; the federal government could try to give it privileged access over private companies. Stricter export controls could halt production. “There is no single sector that can rescue Argentina from its morass,” points out Benjamin Gedan of the Wilson Centre, a think-tank. But in an economically dysfunctional country lithium remains, for now, a rare point of hope.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

    "title": "Update on Timing Frame for Lithium America - Judge Du Rulin",
    "selftext": "I thought I would toss in some color on the current Judge Du timeframe:\n\n1/25/22 - The BLM requested an extension on time to meet the Judge's prior Order to update the Administrative Record (\"AR\") (see 12/27/21 order)\n\n1/26/22 - A Minute Order was filed approving the extension with the new deadline set for 2/11/22\n\nThe Parties all have 3 weeks to review and respond. This sets the response deadline for 3/4/22\n\nAfter that, there is a 30-day period for Judge Du to provide a summary Judgement which sets a \"maximum\" period of 4/4/22 (although it could occur earlier).\n\nIt is only a maximum period if other exogenous events happen (too many to elucidate, but here are a couple of examples):\n\n1. The Winnemucca Indian Colony has filed on 2/11/22 to intervene as a Plaintiff. Responses to this are due by 2/25/22. If accepted, they could throw a kink into the works that could further delay dates.\n2. Between 1/20/22 and the present there has been a flurry of notices/orders related to the withdrawal and substitution of attorneys among the tribal representations. This could lead to another potential delay.\n3. It is possible for a Motion to Dismiss/Summary Judgements to be filed now that the AR has been updated (as of Friday) which would take some time to be heard.\n\nThose are just examples of what could further delay the deadlines.\n\nAssuming that there were no exogenous factors delaying the dates, the range of time for a decision will likely be sometime between 3/7/22 (at the earliest) to 4/4/22.\n\nIn reviewing the 12/27/21 docs and some prior filings. It seems Judge Du is not \"buying\" the tribal 1865 massacre arguments (we see that multiple times in her decisions and analysis of that issue).  Her rationale is that there is no evidence that has been provided that says the massacre occurred on the LAC project territory or that there is definitive evidence that any victims from the massacre made their way to the project area (as the tribe is claiming is a possibility).\n\nHowever, she does appear open to arguments by the Environmentalist side in regards to a potential error in issuing the permits in the first place under the Trump Administration. \n\nHere some anecdotes from the 12/27/21 filing that led me to that conclusion:\n\n1. \" Environmental Plaintiffs’ allegation that BLM should not have approved the ROD without  first finalizing such a monitoring plan and allowing the public to comment on it. (ECF No.  119 at 3-5.) Said otherwise, and as noted, the Court is persuaded by Environmental  Plaintiffs’ argument on this point \"\n2. \" The Court agrees with Environmental Plaintiffs that the NDOW Comment Letter  and the 2020 NDEP Letters are properly part of a complete version of the AR, which  “consists of all documents and materials directly or indirectly considered by agency  decisionmakers and includes evidence contrary to the agency’s position.”\n3. \"Second, there is no dispute that BLM  officials received copies of all three of these letters before they issued the ROD.\"\n4. \" Third, the subject matter of these letters—impacts of the  proposed Project on groundwater and wildlife—are relevant to the decision BLM was  gearing up to make in the ROD, and the letters came from state agencies BLM stated it  was cooperating with in the ROD, so it is hard to see how BLM could not have at least  indirectly considered them.\"\n\nI hope that helps and if anyone has any better refinement on those dates or clarify my comments, feel free to chime in.\n\nIRR",

    "title": "Getting to the bottom of the Lithium America's share count and % ownership by Ganfeng",
    "selftext": "On another LAC board, there was a question stirred up by the controversy of being stirred up by Senator Cotton on Ganfeng % ownership of LAC (e.g., estimates claiming 17%).\n\nI thought it would be helpful to get to the heart of this question as well as to just figure out how many shares (on an \"as if all converted\" fully diluted basis) does LAC have (on a basic basis, fully diluted basis, and \"as if all converted\" fully diluted basis.\n\nLet us first turn to a press release from 2/7/20:\n\n[Lithium Americas and Ganfeng Lithium Announce Caucharí-Olaroz JV Transaction and Provide Construction Update - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-02-07/lithium-americas-and-ganfeng-lithium-announce-cauchar-olaroz-jv-transaction-and-provide-construction-update)\n\nIn that doc, Ganfeng's % ownership of common shares outstanding as of that date was 16.7% (but that is an outdated number, which we will unpack below).\n\nAlso, as of that date, the last Sedar filing on record (from November 12, 2019) reflected a 9/30/2019 share count which would have been used for the % ownership caculation.\n\nOn Sedar, the number of shares outstanding as of 9/30/19 that is listed on page 4 of the Sedar filing is is \\~89,272,000 basic shares.\n\nUsing the 16.7% ownership, this would equate to \\~14,908,424 shares owned by Ganfeng.\n\nHowever, since then there has been multiple dilutive events.\n\nif we now turn to the June 28th, 2022 Sedar financial statements , we can see the basic  shares outstanding of \\~134,596,000 as June 30, 2022 (on page 4).  Note: This also happens to match the 134.6MM shares listed on page 4 of the corporate presentation from LAC's website.\n\nNow taking the 14,908,424 shares owned by Ganfeng that we calculated from before and dividing it by the \\~134,596,000 basic shares outstanding that we found in the Sedar financial statements we can calculate an estimated 11.07642426% by Ganfeng (or rounded to 11.1%) which matches the latest corporate presentation.\n\nSo far so good.\n\nHowever, there are two more fine tuning points which are:\n\n1. There are Deferred Stock Units (1.133MM), Options (0.238MM) and Performance Share Units (0.766MM) which collectively with the 134,596,000 basic shares outstanding brings the fully diluted shares total to 136,713,000.  I say this because all of the above are \"in the money\" and should be reflected as such in any share count calculation.\n2. Additionally we should not forget the convertible debt offering which, although not in the money, will likely soon be in the money if Judge Du gives the BLM an affirmative decision.  From the convertible debt press release below:\n\n[Lithium Americas Closes Over-Allotment on Convertible (globenewswire.com)](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/12/09/2349672/0/en/Lithium-Americas-Closes-Over-Allotment-on-Convertible-Senior-Notes-Offering.html)\n\nWe know that there is $258,750,000 (which includes the over-allotment option). \n\nAt 21.307 shares per $1,000, we know this equates to an additional \\~5,513,186 shares. \n\nThis then brings the total shares outstanding on an \"as-if-converted\" fully diluted basis to \\~142,226,186 shares.  I would use this number instead as the share count for the company should Judge Du's decide in favor of the BLM/LAC.\n\nNow taking the original Ganfeng shares of 14,908,424 and dividing that by the \"as-if-converted\" fully diluted basis amount, we get to \\~10.48% as the final more accurate representation of Ganfeng's ownership in LAC.\n\nTo sum up: The original 17% that was referenced by Senator Cotton's supporters is either erroneously based on a conflated section from page 28 of LAC's corporate presentation that reads as follows:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wruolr8f3cr91.png?width=579&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a0525d009fd2abe265419fb250b390885a7678f\n\n[LAC Corporate Presentation (lithiumamericas.com)](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/_resources/presentations/corporate-presentation.pdf)\n\n...or the old 2/7/20 filings which has since been adjusted downwards to 11.1% presently due to an increase in the basic shares outstanding; However, based on an \"as-if-converted\" fully diluted basis, a truer estimate would be \\~10.48% which factors in all Options, RSUs and DSUs (which are in the money) alongside the prior convertible debt (which is currently out of the money but will soon likely be in the money).\n\nI hope that makes sense and helps LAC shareholders put share counts and Ganfeng's true ownership % in a better perspective,\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

We do know that the structure of the DOE loan will be to cover the majority of the project cost for Thacker Pass.\n\nUntil we receive an affirmation from Thacker Pass (which I would anticipate in the latter half of Q1'23), we will not have much more details on either the DFS or the DOE Loan Program as they go hand in hand.\n\nHope that helps,\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

Strategists also pointed to profit-taking after [battery metal producers rallied on Monday in response to the relaxation of Chinese quarantine rules.](https://archive.ph/o/Z1PiK/https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/iron-ore-producers-storm-back-in-flat-market-20221114-p5by0y) \n\nSentiment was rocked by another bearish report from Goldman Sachs last week, which reiterated that a decline in lithium prices is on the horizon as the ramp-up in supply gathers pace. \n\nThe broker, which [called for a peak in battery metals prices in the second quarter of this year](https://archive.ph/o/Z1PiK/https://www.afr.com/markets/commodities/lithium-shares-crater-as-sentiment-turns-for-battery-material-20220601-p5aqcv), conceded that the lithium market remained tighter than it projected because of robust restocking demand and higher than expected electric vehicle sales in China. \n\nHowever, those conditions have only delayed the market’s inevitable swing into surplus, according to Aditi Rai, global commodities strategist at Goldman Sachs. \n\n“With downstream overcapacity and slowing EV sales likely to become increasingly apparent over the course of next year, we expect downward pressure on the lithium price to build on surplus cues, particularly from the second half of 2023 onward,” she said. \n\n**The broker is now forecasting the lithium market will be in an 84,000-tonne deficit this year, compared to its previous estimate of an 8000-tonne surplus.** That will **flip to a small surplus next year versus prior forecasts for a larger 76,000-tonne surplus**. \n\nAnalysts remain divided on the outlook for lithium stocks, with Macquarie [increasing its Chinese carbonate and hydroxide price forecasts](https://archive.ph/o/Z1PiK/https://www.afr.com/markets/commodities/lithium-prices-prove-immune-to-recession-anxiety-20221109-p5bwpi) last week, prompting it to deliver another round of upgrades for producers and developers. \n\n**UBS also noted that lithium prices have proved “immune” to macroeconomic weakness, reiterating its bullish view on the sector.** \n\nHowever, **Tribeca’s Ben Cleary said that although lithium prices remain “astronomically strong**”, he has taken profits on stocks in the sector as valuations have become too stretched. \n\n“A bit of that froth in lithium stocks had to come off, and now it’s all about how quickly supply comes online,” said Mr Cleary, who runs Tribeca’s Global Natural Resources Fund. \n\n \n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

But these same shares are tumbling today -- down 4.2% through 10:20 a.m. ET -- on news that investment bank **Piper Sandler** has just cut its price target on the stock. \n\n \n\n## So what\n\nIt wasn't a huge cut. Piper Sandler's reduction in price target from $38 a share to $36 a share just shaved 5% off the analyst's estimation of Lithium Americas' profit potential. What's more, Piper continues to believe that Lithium Americas is a stock worth buying, maintaining an [overweight rating](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/upgrades-downgrades/) on the stock.\n\nBut Piper does warn that it sees a \"slight easing\" in lithium demand in the near term, as ratings watcher The Fly reports today. And factoring this easing into its model, the analyst is reducing its earnings forecast for Lithium Americas \"modestly.\"\n\n## Now what\n\nAnd that could be a problem.\n\n \n\nLithium Americans is currently unprofitable, and indeed, producing no revenue at all, according to data from [S&P Global Market Intelligence](http://marketintelligence.spglobal.com/), and analysts expect Lithium Americas to explode into profitability as production begins in 2023. On average, analysts see revenue topping $260 million next year, and growing to more than $1 billion over the next five years. Earnings under generally accepted accounting principles ([GAAP](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/generally-accepted-accounting-principles/)) could be as much as $0.95 per share next year, rising to $3.52 per share by 2026.\n\nPast that, no one seems to be making any earnings estimates. But even just working with what's known, it looks like Piper Sandler must be positing a valuation well in excess of 37 times 2023 earnings for Lithium Americas stock. True, if earnings grow as expected, the analyst's $36 price target would imply only a bit more than a 10x valuation based on 2026 earnings. But given that Lithium Americas hasn't started producing lithium at scale yet, I'd take those 2026 numbers with more than a few grains of lithium salt.\n\nWhile I admit Lithium Americas stock has potential, I'll be a whole lot more comfortable investing in it after the company has succeeded in producing some actual profit -- not just promising to be profitable in the future.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n \n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

Forecasting Lithium Demand Growth to remain strong for 2023\n2. Delay in supply coming on-line\n3. Capacity that does come on-line will need to ramp up over 6 to 18 months\n4. Market will be tight\n5. For forecasting purposes, new producers/supply are overly optimistic and will likely need more time from start to finish (particularly depending on producer's experience).  There is usually some delay from management's original time line for various reasons.\n6. Favorite top stock pick is Lithium Americas for two reasons: 1. Lithium Prices will remain high, 2. Thacker Pass (largest Lithium Resource in US) will likely be approved and enter into production in middle-part of the decade\n7. Forecasting 2023 spot pricing will be closer to $70k/tonne (which is above the bearish forecasts of $15k to $25ks from the likes of Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse)\n8. Contract Pricing for the Majors (Albermarle, Livent on multi-year).  SQM is on spot prices but lags.  Battery makers (Panasonic, LGM) are buying at lower prices (which will likely be an indexed based pricing model which will lag 3-months to 12-months) \\[SIDE NOTE: CONTRACT PRICING FOR ALLKHEM, SQM and Albermarle apear to be in the range of $50k to $56k/tonne\\]\n\nIn the end, Seth Goldstein is factoring a deeper dive in identifying where the disconnect is between Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse forecasts vs. Benchmark, Morningstar, Cowen and others.  It appears to be failure to understand the difficulty in achieving project goals and timelines for mining and the ramp up period for production once a mine is commissioned.\n\nWe remain bullish on Lithium Americas as a result and look forward to the January, 2023 hearing with Judge Du.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

The caldera, which began as a lava dome created by the Yellowstone hotspot more than 11 million years ago during the mid-Miocene, formed after a volcanic eruption caused the dome to collapse.\n\nToday, the caldera — which stretches from Orovada to the Oregon border — is home to dozens of ranches, a few hundred Humboldt County residents, the Fort McDermitt Indian Reservation, and the largest known lithium deposit in the United States.\n\nOn a cold and rainy September day, about 60 students and a few teachers from nearby schools in McDermitt, Kings River, Denio and Fields, and a group of homeschoolers and their parents gathered inside the Orovada Community Center for a long-awaited field trip to learn about geology.\n\nThe field trip was organized by Holly Gallian, a rural programming specialist for 4-H responsible for supplementing the science, technology, engineering, art and math curricula of these small Humboldt County schools.\n\nEvery year, she asks the students she serves what they want to learn.\n\n\"We have a term called 'spark,'\" Gallian said, \"What is it that sparks their interest? What are the things that they're interested in learning about? And for the last couple of years, we've had several of the youth asking specifically \\[about\\] dinosaurs...for rocks, things about fossils and things about volcanoes.\"\n\n\"So I tailor all of that programming and those STEM activities around the topics that they want.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Humboldt County 4-H rural programming specialist Holly Gallian teaches geology to a group of third- through fifth-grade students inside the Orovada Community Center during a field trip on Sept. 21, 2022. Gallian began planning this trip in 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic. \\(David Calvert\\/The Nevada Independent\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/l7k4hracbk2a1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a51a8271f961f50a32dd3fc27fd8055b6d9ec469)\n\nDivided by age into three groups — kindergarten through second grade, third through fifth grade and sixth through eighth grade — students learned about the rock cycle, identified different types of rocks, and drew pictures of the extinct super volcano that formed their northern Humboldt County home.\n\n\"It was an easy fit to be able to say, 'Hey, you know what? Let's build an entire field trip for them, gather all of the schools ... all of these youth, so they can get together and hang out, get to know other people in rural parts of Humboldt County, and also be able to have an opportunity to learn about something that they keep asking for.'\"\n\nThe field trip was made possible through a partnership between 4-H, the school district and Lithium Americas, a Canadian company with plans to mine nearby Thacker Pass (known as Peehee Mu'huh in Paiute).\n\nSince the project's inception, the mine has faced opposition from residents, ranchers and Indigenous communities across the Great Basin, including members of the nearby Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribe.\n\nWork at Thacker Pass was scheduled to begin this fall following the results of a yet-to-be-reported summer archeological survey looking for indications of Indigenous occupation and evidence of an 1865 massacre where Nevada cavalry volunteers murdered as many as 31 Paiutes.\n\nIn an interview with The Sacramento News & Review, Maxine Redstar, chairman of the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribe, said her community is awaiting the report from Far Western Anthropological Research Group, the mining company's consultant.\n\n\"We are cooperating with the BLM and will continue to do so, because having a seat at the table is the most important thing for our people moving forward,\" Redstar said. \"Of course we are concerned about what will be left for our children and those who come after us. We are worried about the balance of how to maintain our culture and traditions, and continuing to progress forward while making sure there is still something there in the future.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Students during a field trip to the proposed site of Lithium Americas' Thacker Pass mine on Sept. 21, 2022. \\(David Calvert\\/The Nevada Independent\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/vofteuyebk2a1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca67780a509b4dd4b3b98f49c32892934b22b028)\n\nIn addition to delays stemming from the archaeological survey, the company's mining permit is being challenged in federal court with a hearing set for Jan. 5, 2023.\n\nOpponents of the mine are asking the court to overturn the Trump administration’s 2021 approval of the project. Its supporters say it is necessary for the fight against climate change.\n\nWhile it waits for final approval, Lithium Americas has been actively working with the local community, including the school district, to establish its \"social license to operate.\"\n\n\"It's important we can educate the folks in our community,\" said Maria Anderson, the company's community relations manager. \"We want them to understand the project that we have at Thacker Pass.\"\n\nField trips like this are part of the company's community relations efforts.\n\n\"If they have questions, we're always available to answer \\[them\\] and provide that information,\" added Anderson. \"And I think, hopefully, one day, \\[these students\\] will be our employees.\"\n\nIn addition to classroom time, students rode buses to Thacker Pass to practice their geology skills with a Lithium Americas geologist and visit the proposed mine site.\n\nBut Gallian said field trips like this aren't just about STEAM education or corporate community building; they are a chance for rural students to make new friends.\n\n\"A lot of these youth have very small schools,\" she said. \"Some of them have five to 10 kids, K-8, so there's not a lot of exposure to other youth, maybe their age. By bringing them together, they can have an entire day of learning about different subjects. And also, they can make friendships with other kids living 150 miles away that they might never usually meet. It gives them a healthy education, but it also helps them develop mentally and socially.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Maria Anderson, right, Lithium Americas' community relations manager, uses Play-Doh to help teach a group of kindergarten through second-grade students about volcanoes on Sept. 21, 2022. \\(David Calvert\\/The Nevada Independent\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/g3ykl2pkbk2a1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=fae149ac5b0118abd3ed7830a0b1418725e33e34)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Students during a field trip to the proposed site of Lithium Americas' Thacker Pass mine on Sept. 21, 2022. \\(David Calvert\\/The Nevada Independent\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/ys4e42mmbk2a1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbaad045db78a4cc4382fd0eb38860ada8799252)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Rachel Hampton, an exploration geologist with Lithium Americas, answers a question from a student about a rock she picked up at the proposed site of the Thacker Pass mine on Sept. 21, 2022. \\(David Calvert\\/The Nevada Independent\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/74p3p9dobk2a1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d2850bc909df8a1575143579108fc49e70a9634)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ A student looks for different types of rocks outside the Orovada Community Center on Sept. 21, 2022. \\(David Calvert\\/The Nevada Independent\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/5no6nyqqbk2a1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f2522b9b7258988ead510489bd6a48bff8fd833)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Student look at rock samples during a field trip to the proposed site of Lithium Americas' Thacker Pass mine on Sept. 21, 2022. \\(David Calvert\\/Nevada Independent\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/qs474jisbk2a1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=47c7003c896889044b7b95ab66d12c17a2d351a7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Two middle school students from McDermitt Combined Schools look at rock samples on Sept. 21, 2022. \\(David Calvert\\/The Nevada Independent\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/7sbdgtzybk2a1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=28a61bacfe654a4efbaca094fed73ec64abb6df3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ An elementary school student from McDermitt shares a drawing he made of a volcano on Sept. 21, 2022. \\(David Calvert\\/The Nevada Independent\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/d2yxwoy0ck2a1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b33703e261a0a776d000a9ed579d33731fd7206)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Second-grader MacKenzie Ellis, center, a homeschool student, during a geology field trip on Sept. 21, 2022, organized by Humboldt County 4-H and Lithium Americas.

(TSX: LAC) (NYSE: LAC)** (“**Lithium Americas**” **or the** “**Company**”) is pleased to announce it has entered a Community Benefits Agreement (“**CBA**”) with the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribe (“**Tribe**”). The Tribe is located approximately 40 miles from the Thacker Pass project, in Humboldt County, Nevada (“**Thacker Pass**” or the “**Project**”). The CBA establishes a framework for continued collaboration and defines the long-term benefits for the Tribe, the largest Native American community within the vicinity of the Project.  \n\n\"We are pleased to have the support of the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribe as we advance Thacker Pass towards construction and look forward to generations of future collaboration,” said Jonathan Evans, President and CEO. “The signing of the CBA is a testament to our Company’s commitment to go beyond our regulatory requirements and to form constructive relationships with the communities closest to our projects. We are focused on being a good neighbor, hiring locally and providing the job training to prepare Tribe members for long-term, family-supporting careers critical to developing a North American battery supply chain.”\n\nThe CBA is a product of years of engagement, job training and relationship-building between the Company and the Tribe. The CBA provides the Tribe additional training and employment opportunities, and support for cultural education and preservation. Furthermore, the Company has agreed to build an 8,000 square feet community center for the Tribe that includes a daycare, preschool, playground, cultural facility and communal greenhouse to support reclamation efforts and provide income for the Tribe.\n\nOver the summer, Far Western Anthropological Research Group, Inc. (“**Far Western**”), with oversight and assistance from Tribe members, completed cultural work on approximately 13,000 acres at Thacker Pass. The cultural work was a key requirement from the National Environmental Policy Act (**“NEPA**”) process and found no areas of archeological significance at the Project.  \n\nThe Company is moving ahead with all areas required to support construction start, including final selection of an engineering, procurement and construction management (“**EPCM**”) contractor, evaluating partnership and supply agreements, as well as progressing the U.S. Department of Energy Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing loan program. The Company has received all federal and state environmental permits necessary to begin construction and awaits a ruling on the appeal against the Bureau of Land Management on the issuance of the Record of Decision. Following the completion of briefings on August 11, 2022, the US District Court, District of Nevada (“**Federal Court**”) has scheduled an oral hearing for January 5, 2023.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nMost notable is the statement:  \"The Company is ***moving ahead with all areas required to support construction start, including final selection of an engineering, procurement and construction management*** (“**EPCM**”) ***contractor***, ***evaluating partnership and supply agreements, as well as progressing the U.S. Department of Energy Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing loan program***.\"\n\nAs we await the January 5th Oral Hearings, we should reflect on the following:\n\n1. The RoD was approved by the BLM in 2022 under the Trump Administration and LAC has the BLM's full support\n2. The Biden Administration has indicated strong support for LAC and identified as a critical mineral battery supply issue\n3. State, County and Cities all support the development (per the sesssions, videos, ribbon cuttings, etc..)\n4. The Local Tribes support the project or are not pursuing a claim (the ones that live within 40 miles of the project that is - as noted above)\n5. The DOE is supportive of the LAC application and is currently sitting on the application waiting on Judge Du\n6. The 9th District Court of Nevada traditionally has a very low percentages of rejecting an Administration Agency case like this (e.g., 5% to 15%)\n7. Judge Du was appointed under the Obama administration\n8. All 7 members of the 9th District Court were appointed by either Obama or Biden\n9. Judge Du has indicated in her filings that she drives an electric vehicle\n10. Far Western Anthropological Research Group found no areas of archeological significance at the Project.  \n\nNow the latter three some would say do not matter, but it points to the mindset of the individual and overall court in question (i.e., Judge Du).\n\nAs for the case in front of Judge Du, I believe it can be boiled down to the following:\n\n1. Did the BLM follow proper procedures and conduct the requisite analysis in accordance with regulations (e.g., Water, Wildlife, Land, Air)\n2. Were external parties properly notified, informed, included, involved pursuant to procedures and regulations?\n3. Are the tribal rights of those who are petitioning being violated related to a massacre that occurred in the mid-1800s outside the territory?\n\nI will address my opinion on these in the upcoming Stock Talk on Sunday, October 23rd at 7pm CDT (link below)\n\n[www.reddit.com/r/LithiumAmerica/comments/y8w7vi/lithium\\_americas\\_stock\\_talk\\_sunday\\_october\\_23rd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LithiumAmerica/comments/y8w7vi/lithium_americas_stock_talk_sunday_october_23rd/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope that helps,\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

    "selftext": "The following Press Release was issued by Lithium Americas:\n\n**October 7, 2022 – Vancouver, Canada: Lithium Americas Corp. (TSX: LAC) (NYSE: LAC) (“Lithium Americas” or the “Company”)** provides an update on the appeal of the issuance of the Record of Decision (“**ROD**”) for the Thacker Pass lithium project (“**Thacker Pass**” or the “**Project**”), located in Humboldt County, Nevada. Following the completion of briefings on August 11, 2022, the US District Court, District of Nevada (“**Federal Court**”) has scheduled an oral hearing for January 5, 2023.\n\n\"With **all state and federal permits received to begin construction**, the ruling on Thacker Pass’ ROD represents the final regulatory hurdle to move forward the largest and most advanced lithium chemicals project in the US,” said Jonathan Evans, President and CEO. “We stand ready to develop a critical source of lithium supply, creating jobs and enabling a more sustainable battery ecosystem in North America. As we await a ruling by the Federal Court, we are **moving ahead with all areas required to support construction, including final selection of an EPCM contractor, evaluating partnership and supply agreements, as well as progressing our application with the US Department of Energy loan program**.”\n\nSince 2021, **all four injunction requests related to the Company’s plan to begin cultural assessment required in the ROD were denied** by the Federal Court, and a **subsequent motion to reconsider was also denied**. In June 2022, the **Nevada State Environmental Commission unanimously upheld the Company’s approved Water Pollution Control Permit for Thacker Pass by denying an appeal in a 5-0 ruling**.\n\nFrom April to July 2022, as part of the Environmental Impact Statement (“**EIS**”) issued by the Bureau of Land Management (“**BLM**”), **analysis of the project site was successfully completed with no archeological significant areas identified** at Thacker Pass. The work, including a cultural inventory across approximately 13,000 acres, was conducted by Far Western Anthropological Research Group, with the oversight and assistance of 11 members of the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribe (the “**Tribe**”). Lithium Americas continues to work closely with the Tribe and is committed to providing additional benefits and job training for long-term, highly skilled careers in the emerging North American battery supply chain.  \n\n[www.lithiumamericas.com/news/lithium-americas-confirms-oral-hearing-schedule-for-the-thacker-pass-record-of-decision-appeal](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/news/lithium-americas-confirms-oral-hearing-schedule-for-the-thacker-pass-record-of-decision-appeal)\n\n[twitter.com/LithiumAmericas/status/1578332443731718145](https://twitter.com/LithiumAmericas/status/1578332443731718145)\n\nIRR,\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

    "selftext": "Livent Corporation, yesterday, hosted their Q3'22 Earnings Call (link below):\n\n[Livent Corporation (LTHM) Q3 2022 Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4551758-livent-corporation-lthm-q3-2022-earnings-call-transcript)\n\nMost notable (in terms of relevance to LAC) were the following statements which reflect an estimated \\~5k tonnes of production in Q3'22 of mixed/lithium production (i.e., broken down as follows: Hydroxide - 49%, Carbonate & Chloride-17%, Butyllithium-25% and Other Specialty - 9%).\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Livent Management Statements relevant to Lithium Americas**\n\n1. \" As we approach the year end, Livent has narrowed the ranges of its full year 2020 to financial guidance, while increasing projections for adjusted EBITDA at the midpoint. This is underpinned by **higher realized pricing in the second half than previously expected**. \"\n2. \"There was also an **FX benefit to adjusted EBITDA, as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus some of our foreign denominated costs**.\"\n3. \"For the full year 2022, Livent now projects revenue to be in the range of $850 million to $845 million, and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $350 million to $370 million. This improvement is largely **underpinned by expectations for slightly higher realized pricing.**\"\n4. \"**published lithium prices in all forms have continued to move higher**, reflecting very tight market conditions. Livent has been able to take an advantage of this by **realizing higher prices on a subset of its volumes that are exposed to market prices**.\"\n5. \" We are **confident in those environment not changing for the rest of the year**. In light we will continue to take advantage of this. \"\n6. \"Despite some near term supply chain disruptions, particularly in China, with energy curtailments and zero tolerance COVID-19 policies, **lithium demand has continued to be incredibly strong**.\"\n7. \" It's also **hard to make a strong case for meaningful shift of supply demand balances as we look out over the foreseeable future.** \"\n8. \" it's **hard to see a probable scenario where the lithium market does not remain structurally tight** to varying degrees, or one way or our industry returns to prior tough pricing levels. \"\n9. \" With respect to **lithium prices from the recent historical highs we've seen over the last few months, there's been little to no evidence of a resulting slowdown in demand**. And even at these higher price levels, lithium so represents a **relatively low percent of the total cost of an electric vehicle**. Additionally, we're seeing many examples record profitability from consumers of lithium and putting major EV and battery producers. \"\n10. \" Additionally, a large portion of these incremental volumes are uncommitted today from a pricing standpoint. So **if market prices remain resilient in 2023, which is in line with our and apparently most other observers expectations, we will achieve higher average realized prices versus 2022**. We therefore confident that we **will generate meaningfully higher cash flow** and a wide range of scenarios. \"\n11. \" So you dress this somewhat in your formal comments about the industry dynamics, but **just obviously demand outstripping supply**. In fact, **one consultancy, we talked to, its pointing to more, I think -- more than I think 800,000 metric tons of demand this year**. So obviously, this is **underpinning a strong pricing cycle**, or maybe even paradigms a better word. \"\n12. \" I personally believe **the day of the fixed price contract has been killed** by the last 12 months. **I don't think anybody's renewing their contract and fixed prices**. I think cash and collars will have a bigger role to play. \"\n13. \" You can get away with a fixed price, when sort of the tension over that price was never too great, the market price is $3 higher or $3 lower. But when the market price is 10s and 10s of dollars higher, you just have too much tension around a fixed price contract. So whichever way you look at it, **fixed price contract probably are no longer going to be part of our industry**, generally speaking, is my own view. And so **as fixed price contracts, do rollover, they're all going to roll over into some form of market based pricing**. \"\n14. In regards to the **Inflation Reduction Act**: \" If the **product is processed into a secondary product, a usable product in the U.S., that will also qualify**. So **lithium carbonate from Argentina, into Bessemer City converted to lithium hydroxide that lithium hydroxide is processed in the U.S. that will qualify.** \"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n* **Summary of Above points**\n\n1. Lithium Carbonate Prices are stronger in Q3'22 than Q2'22 and prior quarters. Prices are expected to be stronger in Q4'22 and going into 2023. Lithium Americas will benefit as 91% of its Cauchari-Olaroz pricing is \"at the market\" pricing and the remaining 9% controlled by LAC will likely be priced \"at the market\" or higher.\n2. Demand remains strong and the Demand/Supply balance/imbalance will remain tight for the foreseeable future (which LAC and Benchmark continue to project/expect elevated prices through 20230).\n3. Foreign Exchange Rates are benefitting Livent (from an operating cost perspective) and will likely benefit LAC given a similar issue as it relates to its Argentina assets (refer to my prior reddit posts about the \"official exchange rate\" which is what determines the capital budget and the \"market-based exchange rate\" which determines what is actually paid (and currently lower to LAC's benefit)\n4. Fixed Priced contracts are going away at these elevated prices and volatility. Market Based pricing will likely become the new norm (i.e., similar to LAC's \"at market prices\" contracts for Cauchari-Olaroz).\n5. Cauchari-Olaroz production may benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act if LAC were to take it's unspoken for 9% of production and Phase 2 of CO production and have it processed in the United States into usable product.\n\nLivent's Q3'22 slide below captures some of the above points and statements:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ki1a82dplx91.png?width=982&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cf2941d8604d914768555f6ba39529e2143bf30\n\nAdditionally, here are a few excerpts from the Livent Q3'22 earnings call presentation that I thought would be useful:\n\n* **Revenues**\n\nAs noted below, with <1/8th of the production capacity of LAC's CO capacity running now, Revenues for Livent were \\~232MM (i.e., just below $50k/tonne - but it's important to note that many of Livent's contracts are set as fixed price contracts and not \"at market\" prices which Livent said will drag the prices down). Additionally, Livent has already achieved positive Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fwbksajeplx91.png?width=951&format=png&auto=webp&s=03f390c1cfe9f6ce87833f2d9d7a11d4267cc55c\n\n* **Cash Flow**\n* Even at these levels, Livent is achieving YTD Operating Cash flows of \\~$330MM which bodes well for Lithium Americas whose production will be significantly higher when Cauchari Olaroz reaches full production\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iwui63ofplx91.png?width=1056&format=png&auto=webp&s=653a72beb4fed06e1f43a24803d177e1679dd58f\n\nIt's important to note that Allkem and SQM are seeing similar Pricing and Demand tailwinds from their latest quarterly earnings calls.\n\nIMHO, this bodes well for Cauchari-Olaroz and Lithium Americas as a whole.\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

    "title": "Lithium prices prove ‘immune’ to recession anxiety (11/9/22)",
    "selftext": "Lithium prices prove ‘immune’ to recession anxiety\n\n Lithium is proving to be largely immune from the volatility that has rocked commodity markets as prices soar in the face of a looming global recession, prompting Macquarie to deliver another round of upgrades for producers and developers of the battery metal. \n\n Lithium prices have [continued to hit record levels this year](https://archive.ph/o/YoHBo/https://www.afr.com/companies/mining/lithium-price-rockets-45pc-with-no-end-in-sight-20220204-p59trs) with spodumene, carbonate and hydroxide surging 243 per cent, 124 per cent and 152 per cent respectively. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j4q20viayf0a1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bc63a451fd24f9b505b3d1a6cc4d32ad35d2182\n\n This has fuelled more gains for producers of the battery material which were among the [best performers on the S&P/ASX 200](https://archive.ph/o/YoHBo/https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/shares-gain-as-james-hardie-sims-warn-on-global-economy-20221108-p5bwj7) again on Tuesday, and extended their rally on Wednesday. \n\n Mineral Resources added 4.5 per cent to $82.70, Core Lithium climbed 4 per cent to $1.56, IGO firmed 2.9 per cent to $16.12 and Allkem jumped 2.4 per cent to $15.83 on Wednesday. \n\n The record-breaking run in prices comes despite strict COVID-19 restrictions in China which have weighed on the broader commodity market, and the aggressive tightening by central banks which has hit demand for raw materials. \n\n However, lithium prices continue to trend higher as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) look past near-term headwinds to secure supply for their 2024-25 electric vehicle sales targets, according to UBS. \n\n “Lithium prices so far \\[have been\\] immune to macro weakness,” said Levi Spry, mining analyst at UBS. This is “despite the obvious headwinds of China, European electric vehicle sales disappointing, and inflationary and monetary policy factors”. \n\n Macquarie also reiterated its bullish outlook on the lithium sector on Tuesday despite citing near term headwinds, with analysts noting that supply security is gaining momentum and could lead to an even tighter market in the short term. \n\n While lithium companies have tried to ramp up supply to capitalise on high prices, analysts highlighted that output in the September quarter was mixed, with misses in production and delays in project commissioning. \n\n Macquarie doesn’t expect to see material volumes from new spodumene producers until next year. \n\n These factors prompted the broker to upgrade its Chinese carbonate and hydroxide price forecasts for 2022 to 2027 by between 5 per cent and 130 per cent, and its regional projections for 2023 to 2027 by between 30 per cent and 130 per cent to match the pricing strength in China. \n\n Macquarie also upgraded its short and medium-term spodumene forecasts to reflect its expectation of a persistent market deficit, and lifted its peak price assumption by 30 per cent to $US6500 per tonne. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2oiw77tnyf0a1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=4955dfa9cdef718e1ab7e5f0cd56a9342d0d1579\n\n “Our forecasts expect the market to remain in deficit given the limited additional output in the near term,” Macquarie analysts said. “More importantly, we highlight that EV penetration rates are forecast to grow further over the medium term.” \n\n Macquarie implemented material upgrades to its earnings forecasts for both lithium miners and developers under its coverage to account for higher prices. \n\n The broker lifted its price target on Mineral Resources by 28 per cent to $120 and retained its “outperform” rating, and increased its target on Pilbara Minerals by 31 per cent to $7.70, adding that the company offers the greatest leverage to spodumene prices. \n\n Price targets for developers including Liontown Resources, Core Lithium and Global Lithium Resources were lifted by between 12 per cent and 38 per cent. \n\n UBS said it remained positive on the lithium sector, and maintained its “buy” ratings on Allkem and Mineral Resources, “neutral” recommendation on IGO and “sell” rating for Pilbara Minerals. \n\n Morgan Stanley is less bullish, and believes that spot prices in China will likely experience a correction by next year on the back of demand headwinds and expanding supply. \n\n The broker pointed to supply growth in Chile and Australia, but acknowledged that project delays and other challenges are present throughout the industry. \n\n Meanwhile, EV demand in China is back in “growth mode”, but has been softer in other key regions such as the US and Germany. \n\n While Morgan Stanley expects lithium to be more resilient to a recession than other battery materials such as nickel and cobalt, the broker believes it looks expensive against the current macroeconomic backdrop. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n \n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

To have  secured 100% ownership of our key assets, including our flagship Seymour Mine Development, further cements our strategic  industry positioning. It also removes the implicit economic burden of a free-carried minority interest over these assets.”\n\n“It is full steam ahead at GT1. We are drilling intensively at both Seymour and our Root Project. We are also undertaking  multiple metallurgical testwork programs, alongside all our environmental and permitting baseline work, as we rapidly  progress the requisite PEA workstreams for Seymour. Finally, we remain attuned to potential further project and/or  strategic transactional opportunities within Ontario, and more broadly.”\n\n“Key outcomes from these activities are set to flow over coming months, including ongoing drilling and assay results, a  further resource update at Seymour, a maiden resource estimate at Root, and scheduled completion of the Seymour PEA,  including downstream facility development, in H1 2023. All of this is set to occur against an ongoing backdrop of aggressive  governmental and end user incentivisation of new North American domiciled lithium supply sources, including via the recent  game-changing Inflation Reduction Act 2022 legislation in the U.S.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ji98hz2buv91.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fd5543c613a88eb4a3e7d7dc0cbc10c461ab226\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nAgain, it is important to remember that LAC has an \\~5.2% equity interest (from a prior $10MM investment in private placement)  in GT1 as well as a Collaboration Agreement to explore exporation & development for a vertically integrated midstream supply chain.  Because of the Ontario Lithium's proximity to the US Auto manufacturing sector, and also because GT1 would be eligible for benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act, there is a significant opportunity for both GT1 and LAC in the near future.\n\nWhile this is still all very early stage, we can see ongoing progress in GT1's story and we look forward to seeing more announcements in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

Thacker Pass is the United States' largest known lithium reserve and the world's second largest.

If (and when) Lithium America's Thacker Pass mining unit is approved, there is even more reason to think they will command just as much, if not higher, premium.\n\nJohn Evans in early 2021 forecasted that this would begin to happen (specifically identifying Korean and Japanese companies) in terms of onshoring in North America (see min 14:30 and beyond):\n\n [BNEF Summit 2021: North America Automotive and Battery Supply Chain (1/4) on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/515203029) \n\nWe are getting close now to a conclusion of a long and weary journey for most LAC shareholders and I can see the light peaking around the end of the tunnel.\n\nI Hope this helps and GLTA,\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to\n\n1.

    "selftext": "Today's announcement below is significant and reflects my prior post that last week (on Friday) the DOE had requested a formal application having reviewed the prior draft pre-application (this is a VERY positive sign of interest on the part of the DOE in support of LAC).\n\nThis also reflects Jon Evans commentary that the DOE is eager to get this done and claims they can accelerate and approve this application within 4 months (my guess is that this will still be pending a final positive ruling from Judge Du on the Record of Decision related to Thacker Pass and a potential spinoff/separation of US vs. Non-US assets).\n\nAgain, the benefits of this loan, if approved, are tremendous from a shareholder value creation in that:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. It provides Senior secured Fixed Rate US Treasury Debt at one of the lowest cost rates of financing, US Treasury Rates, (low single digits and currently \\~3%) with no credit spread and with long tenors available and flexible structures\n2. It solidifies Funding for the TP project (if you track Lasonde curves, this is a value creation segment for any mining company)\n3. It reduces/ and possibly eliminates any equity dilution to LAC from either raising capital from other investors or strategic partners\n4. It potentially establishes a longer relationship with the DOE / Government for funding of future expansion on faceplate capacity/production in the TP/Caldera resource\n5. Potentially will lead to off-take agreements\n6. It may accelerate development plans help ensure a production start of 2025/2026\n\nHere is a link to an FAQ sheet regarding the ATVM Loan Program:\n\n[www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2020/01/f70/DOE-LPO-ATVM-Jan2020.pdf](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2020/01/f70/DOE-LPO-ATVM-Jan2020.pdf)\n\nAs part of the process, will be entering into phase 3: the \"Due Diligence & Negotiation phase\" and will likely get to a \"conditional commitment offer\" at the end (e.g., within the next 4 months).  My guess, once this is done, they will parallel track the negotiation of loan documents in anticipation of Judge Du's decision.\n\nI find it likely that Judge Du would have a favorable ruling (but it is not a certainty).  However, if she does side favorably in Q3, this will be a very favorable transaction for LAC, and the combination of the ruling and a loan approval (if it happens) can lead to strong triple digit returns for shareholders.  If the ruling is favorable to LAC, than I would expect a followon announcement shortly afterwards of a completion and execution of the DOE ATVM loan documents.\n\nI personally still remain cautious on buying additional shares of LAC until the Q3 ruling is resolved, but I remain optimistic and I hope that these posts help put some context on the announcement below:\n\nIRR\n\n# Lithium Americas Submits Formal Application for Department of Energy ATVM Loan Program\n\n**April 14, 2022 – Vancouver, Canada: Lithium Americas Corp.** **(TSX: LAC) (NYSE: LAC) (\"Lithium Americas\" or the \"Company\")** is pleased to announce the Company has submitted a formal application to the US Department of Energy (“**DOE**”) Loan Programs Office (“**LPO**”) for funding to be used at its 100%-owned Thacker Pass lithium project in Humboldt County, Nevada (“**Thacker Pass**”) through the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (“**ATVM Loan Program**”). The ATVM Loan Program is designed to provide loans for facilities located in the United States for the manufacturing of advanced technology vehicles and qualifying components used in those vehicles.\n\n\"Thacker Pass is a unique, large-scale and advanced-stage lithium project representing one of the most significant opportunities to create a domestic lithium supply chain to support the production of electric vehicles in the US,” said Jonathan Evans, President and CEO. “We are pleased to submit our formal loan application and look forward to progressing through the ATVM Loan Program process to accelerate development of Thacker Pass. We are very excited to become a leading supplier of domestic critical materials to support the growth of the domestic battery and electric vehicle industry in response to increased demand and interest from US-based consumers.”\n\nThe submission is not an assurance that Lithium Americas will secure funding from the ATVM Loan Program and additional steps remain in the process.",

    "title": "Clarification on Lithium Americas and LCE Pricing",
    "selftext": "I wanted to clarify some additional \"misinformation\" I see circulating through the message boards.\n\nFirst, I am very long LAC.\n\nThat said, there seems to be a belief that the LCE China spot market pricing we are seeing is a proxy for the contracted pricing LAC will see once its assets go into production.\n\nThis is NOT correct.\n\nMost publicly traded companies are entering negotiated multi-year contracts today with pricing in the neighborhood of $20k to $30k per tonne.\n\nLAC is no exception.\n\nThere are multiple interviews recently that Jon Evans (CEO of LAC) is trying to correct the error in this perception.\n\nHere is a link to the most recent interview on YouTube dated 4/1/22 (jump to min 18'22):\n\n[www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxQ1Vxv70wI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxQ1Vxv70wI)\n\nFrom the video, CEO Johnathan Evans leads by saying: \"I know some of the retail shareholders will be angry when I say this, but $70k per ton lithium prices are a tiny market and just the tip of the iceberg.  We're getting $20k to $30k per tonne\"  \n\n\nHe goes on to explain both in that video and prior video interviews in March that rates they anticipate getting will be in that range for all their mines and that the spot market is only a reflection of the highest rates paid (e.g., essentially, small/desperate players with little to no negotiating power and in small volumes with short term needs)  \n\n\nThese contracts are likely being negotiated now in anticipation of production start for Cauchari in the latter half of the year and I have no reason to doubt Jon as he has always been a straight shooter (during the years I have followed the company).  \n\n\nNote, $20k to $30k per tonne is still very attractive for LAC and \\~2x that of the prices used in the feasibility studies analyses and is still attractive for LAC.  \n\n\nI do believe LAC has long term value, but it may not be the sky high numbers I have seen be tossed out by people believing that somehow LAC will get numbers closer the $70k per tonne found in China short term spot pricing.  \n\nJon Evans has indicated in this interview and in two other interviews over the last 30 days that pricing will be in the range of $20k to $30k per tonne in an attempt to not shock retail investors when the filings come out later this year.\n\nAgain, I am long LAC, but, with the recent runup, it is dangerous for retailers to be misinformed on what the potential rates will be.\n\nI have rerun numbers for LAC using the feasibility studies and the shares at the high end of the company's stated price range, and, if Thacker Pass is allowed to proceed (pending Judge Du's rulings expected in Q3 this year), share prices will remain attractive.\n\nAs Jon Evans said, I know the retail shareholder audience will not like hearing any of this, but I thought it important to help clarify an important point for LAC to balance the conversation with more accurate information in the face of a deluge of misinformation that is going on.\n\nI hope that helps you guys and looking forward to the Q3 Record of Decision ruling by Judge Du.\n\nIRR",

    "selftext": "The following is the link to Benchmark Mineral's article re\n\n&#x200B;\n\n [Lithium oversupply? Not likely - five main reasons why | Benchmark (benchmarkminerals.com)](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/membership/lithium-oversupply-not-likely-five-main-reasons-why/) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n# LITHIUM OVERSUPPLY? NOT LIKELY – FIVE MAIN REASONS WHY\n\n9th June 2022 [Lithium](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/category/lithium/)\n\nLast week Goldman Sachs published a research note entitled “Battery Metals Watch: The End of the beginning.”\n\nWhile it is not Benchmark Mineral Intelligence policy to comment on other reports, we felt the note sent incorrect signals to the market and, therefore, we are pleased to outline our view as has been requested by industry and investors alike.\n\nGoldman Sachs said it expected the lithium market “to pivot towards a prolonged phase of surplus starting this year.”\n\nDue to the shock to the investment markets and many requests for a response, Benchmark is outlining its reasons why we believe the call on lithium was wrong.\n\n#### THE INDUSTRY CANNOT RELY ON CHINA FEEDSTOCK MEETING THE MARKET \n\nGoldman sees the most “significant” new [lithium supply](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/membership/where-will-new-lithium-supply-come-from-in-2022/) as coming from China, where companies have invested in new hard rock and brine projects.\n\nBut known domestic Chinese spodumene and other hard rock resources are low quality, a key reason why there has been an increasing reliance by Chinese converters on Australia for supply instead.\n\nChinese brine resources are also low quality and have always struggled to produce meaningful volumes of lithium into the market, let alone of battery-grade quality.\n\nProduction of lithium from China’s Qinghai province has struggled to ramp up production despite over a decade of efforts, including by electric car maker BYD.\n\nChina’s deposits of lepidolite, which Goldman expects to add significant new supply volumes, may have the potential to help bridge the deficit in coming years, but are unlikely to lead to oversupply. Chinese lepidolite processing has a high waste-to-ore ratio of 20:1, subsequent high waste-disposal costs, and high processing costs, all of which make it a marginal source of lithium. Associated opex and ramp up times are also commonly underestimated.\n\n#### CAPACITY DOES NOT EQUAL SUPPLY \n\nBuilding capacity in the lithium market does not equal supply, particularly in China, where companies often need to separate designed capacity from effective capacity. Of that capacity, recovery rates apply – the rock you dig out of the ground will not all make it into a car.\n\nEven outside of China, planning does not always equal reality, with recent efforts to build lithium processing facilities suffering from rising costs and delays.\n\nTianqi Lithium’s Kwinana lithium hydroxide refinery in Western Australia was announced in late 2016 and set to start at the end of 2018. Instead, first production occurred in the second quarter of this year, with full production targeted for 2025.\n\n“Building upstream of the EV battery supply chain takes time and rarely goes to plan,” Simon Moores, chief executive of Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said. “For Tianqi it’s been the best part of a decade.”\n\n#### NEW LITHIUM SUPPLY COMES AT A HIGHER COST BASE \n\nAs demand for lithium grows, deposits with unconventional mineralogy, lower grades, and higher strip ratios will be developed. But at the same time, the advent of new, often smaller and inexperienced converters with unintegrated feedstock sources will mean that the costs of conversion increases, and recovery rates stagnate.\n\nIn the last two years, higher inflation, supply chain bottlenecks and cost-blowouts have pushed incentive prices higher. Some new lithium supply also relies on new technologies which will add higher costs.\n\nAs a result it’s unlikely that lithium prices will drop back down to previous lows.\n\n#### CONTRACT PRICING IS IMPORTANT AS THE MARKET BALANCES \n\nBenchmark tracks the volume of lithium under contracts and spot prices, and forecasts prices accordingly. A large portion of the market is under long term fixed price contracts, and an equally significant portion is under contract with variable prices. These must be taken into account when balancing global prices in the current market, but also forecasting for the next two to three years.\n\nCombined with existing contracting arrangements set in 2022, prices are very unlikely to crash in 2023 and 2024, according to [Benchmark’s Lithium Forecast](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/forecasts/#lithium). Benchmark’s view is that contract prices are likely to continue to rise as a lagged effect of the major step-change in spot pricing over late 2021 and 2022 while spot prices will fall, with the two prices coming into more of an equilibrium than they are now.\n\nIt’s important to remember that there is no one single lithium price.\n\n#### UNDERSTANDING HOW LITHIUM CHEMICAL CAPACITY IS USED IS CRUCIAL \n\nA lot of lithium chemical capacity is being used to reprocess material that does not meet downstream specifications. This eats up existing capacity and merely represents lower efficiency production rather than the introduction of new lithium units to market.\n\nWhen the rest of the world slowed its lithium investment in the trough of the previous price cycle, China remained aggressively committed to adding conversion capacity; often from relative newcomers to the industry.\n\nNot only will a lot of this new capacity operate at a low utilisation rate in the initial years of production (if not, indefinitely), a significant proportion of capacity that does find its way to market is locked into reprocessing or tolling arrangements which will not address the underlying market shortfall.\n\n#### CONCLUSION: LITHIUM MARKET REMAINS IN STRUCTURAL SHORTAGE UNTIL 2025\n\nThe lithium market will balance over the next few years, but it’s unlikely that an unprecedented rampup of marginal, unconventional feedstock will fill the deficit. It is also unlikely that demand will weaken significantly.\n\nIt will be a touch-and-go market balance; but there will not be the structural oversupply that Goldman Sachs is predicting.\n\nIn a period when we’ve seen prices top record highs persistently over the past 10 months, a correction in the lofty spot market prices seen in China is likely. End-users can only absorb so much cost pass through before it has an unsustainable impact on their electric vehicle ambitions.\n\nHowever, the spot market price in China does not represent the true price of lithium in the market, and is often not the true price being paid by western battery majors.\n\nIn these markets we expect to see a gradual ramp up in contract deals being settled with increasingly flexible, and more frequent, pricing mechanisms.\n\nAs the market wrestles between long-term supply security to fuel the lithium ion economy, and increasingly market-led pricing mechanisms to incentivise supply growth, the era of lithium market volatility is likely just beginning.",

    "title": "Benchmark Mineral Intelligence Response to Lithium Supply Claims",
    "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n [Lithium: How Goldman Sachs Got It SO WRONG - NXTmine](https://www.nxtmine.com/energy-metals/lithium-how-goldman-sachs-got-it-so-wrong/) \n\n \n\n**Goldman Sachs is dead wrong in its poorly-researched assessment of**  \n**lithium supply/demand fundamentals. This is according to the world’s**  \n**leading lithium market intelligence firm.**\n\n**Benchmark Mineral Intelligence** just published a rebuttal to the investment bank’s  \nrecent proclamation that raw lithium supplies will become abundant for several years  \n– and that spot prices are due for a precipitous fall from grace.\n\nIn Benchmark’s five-point counter-thesis, the research firm explains why it expects  \nbattery-grade lithium supplies to remain tight over the next several years. More on  \nthis in a moment.\n\nFirst, let’s look at the firestorm of controversy that Goldman Sachs has ignited in the  \ncapital markets over lithium spot prices, sending lithium mining stocks tumbling. The  \nlightening rod in this case involves a report ominously entitled “Battery Metals Watch:  \nThe End of the Beginning”.\n\nThis is where Goldman Sachs analyst Nicholas Snowdon bluntly asserts, “…we see  \nthe battery metals bull market as over for now”.\n\nHe points the finger at investor exuberance for catapulting spot prices to a recent  \nhigh of $78,000 a tonne, and cautions that prices are destined to crash back down to  \nas little as $16,372 by the end of next year.\n\n“That fundamental mispricing has in turn generated an outsized supply response well  \nahead of the demand trend,” he says. “In this context, we see prices on a downward  \ntrajectory over the course of the next two years, with a sharp correction in lithium.”  \nThe crux of his argument is that China is about to ramp-up production in a big way,  \ncausing a market over-supply. He envisions a boost in output of as much as 33%  \nyear on year between 2022 and 2025.\n\n“On lithium, we see China expansions likely to be more and faster than consensus  \nexpectations, especially regarding integrated hard rock projects”, he states.\n\n**Why a Lithium “Over-Supply” is Pie in the Sky**  \nBenchmark’s own report that’s a retort to Goldman Sachs’ controversial  \nprognostication is boldly entitled “Lithium oversupply? Not Likely – Five Main  \nReasons Why”.\n\nThe report argues that any new Chinese lithium feedstock coming onstream will be  \ninsufficient to meet global demand for the next several years. Which is largely  \nbecause these greenfields deposits are expected to be of low-quality, and much of  \nthe lithium produced will not be good enough to be considered battery-grade.  \nAlso, Benchmark points to the fact that China has already tried without much  \nsuccess in recent years to expedite an increase in its own domestically mined lithium  \nsupplies. Hence, this explains why China’s mining powerhouses have invested so  \nheavily in Australian hard rock operations instead and in Latin American brine-based  \ndeposits.\n\nOutside of China, the ramp-up of new projects in Australia is likewise unlikely to  \nhappen as fast as Goldman Sachs believes to be the case, according to Benchmark.  \nThis is largely due to the long timelines involved in building and commercializing new  \nmines, especially brine-based ones, which account for 30% of global output.  \nFor instance, new deposits can take as long as 10 years to finally get commissioned.  \nAnd some don’t deliver anywhere near as much high-purity lithium as anticipated.  \nIn Benchmark’s report, its CEO, Simon Moores, cites Chinese lithium mining  \nheavyweight Tianqi Lithium as an example of the mining industry’s inability to bring  \ngreenfields projects on-steam on an expedited timeline.\n\n“Building upstream of the EV battery supply chain takes time and rarely goes to plan.  \nFor Tianqi it’s been the best part of a decade.”\n\nOther major considerations include the fact that global supply chain bottlenecks,  \ncapital expenditure cost-blowouts, and rampant inflation are all contributing to the  \nincreasingly expensive price tags and long timelines involved in building new mines.  \nBenchmark insists that all of these factors are destined to contribute to higher  \nproduction costs, regardless of where in the world the lithium is mined.\n\nAdditionally, deposits with unconventional mineralogy, lower grades, and higher strip  \nratios are now being developed. And new, unproven extraction technologies are  \nbeing developed. All of these considerations further contribute to exponentially  \nescalating production costs.\n\n  \nSo the macro drivers for a vicious pullback in lithium spot prices simply do not exist,  \nBenchmark surmises. Instead, spot prices are therefore only likely to experience a  \nfar more modest retracement, the report says.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s17laekqb1791.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=bba0b8342689fd51a5a78c3aba5f1fcd3f43245c\n\nThe other key point that Benchmark takes issue with is Goldman Sachs’ seemingly  \nnaïve belief that lithium spot prices are integral to determining market prices. In fact,  \nlithium suppliers typically sign long-term fixed contracts with buyers for  \npredetermined quantities of lithium at predetermined prices.\n\n“The spot market price in China does not represent the true price of lithium in the  \nmarket and is often not the true price being paid by western battery majors,”  \nBenchmark states.\n\nKnown as “offtake agreements”, fixed contracts give buyers price protection against  \nvolatile spot prices, while also guaranteeing sellers the assurance of having long-  \nterm buyers for large quantities of lithium.\n\nWhereas over-inflated spot prices are due for a modest correction, Benchark says  \ncontract prices between miners and EV battery manufacturers are headed higher for  \nthe next several years due to increased capital expenditures and fast-rising  \noperational costs.\n\n“In these markets we expect to see a gradual ramp up in contract deals being settled  \nwith increasingly flexible, and more frequent, pricing mechanisms.”\n\nBenchmark concludes that the raw lithium market will remain in what it refers to as a  \n“structural shortage” until 2025 with no abatement in rising demand.\n\n“The lithium market will balance over the next few years, but it’s unlikely that an  \nunprecedented ramp-up of marginal, unconventional feedstock will fill the deficit. It is  \nalso unlikely that demand will weaken significantly.”\n\nAs a caveat to its bearish stance, Goldman Sachs’ points out that any slump in  \nlithium spot prices is not expected to last for long, with battery demand expected to  \ngrow ten-fold by 2030.\n\n“Our bearish view on the fundamental path for battery as a raw material is not rooted  \nin a negative take on demand prospects. We continue to expect a strong trend of  \ngrowth in EV demand underpinned by increasingly supportive policy globally led by  \nEurope and China,” Snowden says.\n\nAt least Benchmark and Goldman Sachs are on the same page about something.  \nAfter all, only a fool would bet long-term against the Green Energy Revolution’s  \ninsatiable hunger for battery-grade lithium.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n *Author: Knox Henderson is a journalist with numerous features on established investment media*  \n*sources.

The NPV of the Millennial Lithium project (aka Pastos Grande) at current prices (in reviewing the Feasibility Study) implies that it has the potential to provide triple-digit returns when compared to the acquisition price of Millenial.  \n\nMillennial was at the stage of development of \"pre-financing\" when looking at the Lasonde Curve.  Often times that value is not realized for a company due to an inability to access capital in a low-cost or non-dilutive or timely fashion.  Lithium America derisks that risk on and increases the value of the Pastos Grande project further along the Lasonde Curve (since Millennial will soon be flush with capital from the proceeds generated by Cauchari production starting this year)..\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nLithium America is on the cusp of beginning production of the Cauchari asset in Argentina in the 2nd half of 2022. \n\nDue to elevated Lithium prices, it will produce significant positive free cash flows this year and going forward for many years to come \n\nbefore sufficient supply is able to come online (if you examine the demand-supply gap).\n\nThis cash flow can be used to help finance several items:\n\na. Stage 2 of their production capacity at Cauchari (i.e., currently at 40k tpa going to 60k tpa with a construction start on Stage 2 in 2022 after Stage 1 goes into production) \n\nb. Finance other projects (i.e., Thacker Pass to production in 2026 - possibly earlier, Millenial Lithium to production in 2025 - possibly earlier, and potentially with the acquisition and development of Arena Minerals which they have a growing but still minority stake in).\n\nc. LAC will be able to further exploration efforts of Thacker Pass beyond the existing resource (given the 120MM tonnes of potential resource expected in the caldera)\n\nThe stream of cash flows about to unfold for LAC avoids the necessity of another strategic partner or taking on dilutive transactions or signficant amounts of debt.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThacker Pass, if and once the courts rule on the outstanding appeal this quarter, will go into construction in the 2nd half of this year with a production start expected in 2026.  The interesting aspect on Thacker Pass is that the caldera it is part of is ownly partially explored and being developed and there is evidence that it may hold upwards of 120MM Tonnes of resource (i.e., further expansion)\n\nIf all goes well, it is likely that Millenial Lithium will break ground potentially as early as next year.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe pipelines of opportunity that Lithium America is laying down will make it one of the top 5 lithium producers in the world. Most recently they have been growing their ownership of the nearby Arena Minerals project and there is general speculation of an acquisition that may be in play contingent on further delineation progress on the project and moving forward on the Thacker Pass and cash flow from the Cauchari asset.  This would be the fourth potential deposit in a stream of near term production assets that the company is pursuing.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nYou can find more information about Lithium America on their latest corporate presentation found here:\n\nhttps://www.lithiumamericas.com/\\_resources/presentations/corporate-presentation.pdf?v=0.3\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nIf you like what you read, and wish to stay up to date on further insights and analyses on LAC as well as other securities, feel free to follow us at:\n\n[Stock Talk with In the Ruff Research | Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/IntheRuffResearch/)\n\nIn the meantime,\n\nHappy New Year and Happy Investing!",

With Trump's plan to squash the EV tax credit, impose tariffs on battery materials, and rethink loans to companies like Rivian, I’m genuinely worried about how this will affect EV sales.\n\nTariffs could raise prices drastically in the short term, and we already don’t have enough domestic lithium. I feel like juniors like Rivian might struggle, and big players could pull back on their EV plans. Plus, if lithium prices drop because of low demand, new projects like Lithium Americas might not even be viable.\n\nHonestly, I think the upcoming lithium shortage will happen no matter what, just as TP is coming online.

    "selftext": "Many people have been asking why they haven't made the Final Investment Decision and issued the Full Notice to Proceed. It's as simple as this: They are still engineering the plant. Detailed Engineering is only at 40%. **There's only so much you can figure out along the way** and the last thing they want to do is have to demo a freshly-poured concrete slab because they realized after the pour they need more pipes or conduits underground for such-and-such system. Nor do they want to build the plant shell only to realize it needs to be bigger and now they have to demo a wall and (as an example) rebuild it 20' south. Imagine that were to happen: a piece of process equipment turns out to be bigger than they thought. Now they have to demo a wall, but only after they bring in equipment to support the ceiling in that area. Oh and let's not forget the electrical equipment that was mounted on that wall. Now that needs to be Demo'd and rebuilt. Think about how expensive that is. Think about how time-consuming that is. When something like that happens it has a ripple effect on all the other systems. So that wall's gotta move 20' south? Now the HVAC system must be redesigned.  The Roof and Roof Drainage System modified. Also the Fire Protection (Sprinkler) System. And the Life Safety (Fire Alarm & Gas Detection) Systems. And the Lighting System. Now all the initial permits go out the window and they have to go in for revised permits with the redesigned systems. While they're waiting for new permits you might have hundreds of workers sequestered at the Workforce Hub (Camp) away from their wives, families, and girlfriends with nothing to do but drink and play cards. Fights break out. All of the aforementioned is hypothetical but you get the point. It's a 3-Billion Dollar Plant that they want to design and build right the first time, without any surprises or anything that might interrupt construction. They are \"targeting\" YE2024 for the FID/FNTP.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6l3fwmnelf4e1.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab9cce129a738e3ee5f10bc0ff018984a87cdda6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lx0ponnelf4e1.png?width=1619&format=png&auto=webp&s=761145699bc9d7bcdca78d6e76fec4587c994a91",

The joint project, [which was announced in April 2022](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/04/honda-and-general-motors-will-collaborate-on-affordable-evs-from-2027/), was supposed to develop a new platform for use in lower-cost EVs for North America, South America, and China, with cars appearing in 2027. But on Thursday, the two companies revealed that the plan is no more.\n\n\"After extensive studies and analysis, we have come to a mutual decision to discontinue the program. Each company remains committed to affordability in the EV market,\" Honda and GM said in a joint statement.\n\n\"After studying this for a year, we decided that this would be difficult as a business, so at the moment we are ending development of an affordable EV,\" said Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe [in an interview with Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-25/honda-ceo-says-scrapping-plans-with-gm-to-develop-smaller-evs). \"GM and Honda will search for a solution separately.

    "selftext": "Members of our Lithium Americas Whatsapp Research group were alerted to the following filing from Judge Du that was filed on Friday, December 2nd and identified by the public this morning (see link below for the court document or further below for the actual images of the document in question):\n\n[Bartell Ranch LLC v. McCullough, 3:21-cv-00080 – CourtListener.com](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/59247337/bartell-ranch-llc-v-mccullough/?filed_after=&filed_before=&entry_gte=&entry_lte=&order_by=desc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vz3uxwj3144a1.png?width=795&format=png&auto=webp&s=57b68b7d65739b79e86c5050e9c2296bdb688c88\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jq765pu1244a1.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac93263674a0dff110d1ca8c019252235cb4148d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe most relevant excerpts to LAC, from that filing, are as follows:\n\n1. In the final paragraph of her filing, and in regards to the Environmental Plaintiffs claim, the Court is interested in the extent to which \"**Ctr for Biological Diversity vs. United States Fish & Wildlife Serv. 33 F.4th 1202 (9th Cir. 2022)\" controls the outcome** of this case.\n2. The Court expects the **parties to be prepared to address the scope of any relief that may be appropriate were the Court to agree with Environmental Plaintiff's argument based on that case and remand it back to the BLM**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are not lawyers and do not claim to be, so any opinions expressed in this post are just opinions and can be wrong and you should seek legal counsel to do your own assessment.\n\nWhile there is no ability to predict with certainty where Judge Du's mindset is, this latest filing seems to imply that Judge Du believes that the case cited (\"Rosemont\") may be the \"controlling\" case that would \"control the outcome of this case\" (as stated in the filing).\n\nThis, in our opinion, is the first indication as to where the current mindset is for Judge Du in that she may view the cited case as having merit and relevance and is crucial to the decision/outcome on the case (something we have discussed before as a possibility in our whatsapp research group as a primary and leading factor for concern relative to the tribal and rancher arguments).\n\nThe fact that Judge Du has asked that the parties be prepared to address what **\"relief may be appropriate were the Court to agree with Environmental Plainttif's argument and remand it back to the BLM\"** is likely an indication of what her bench order and final decision may be as well.  We do not think she would ask for this preparation on requested relief **solely** in the event of a Remand unless there is a reasonable probability of her siding with the Plaintiff on this issue and that there would be a remand as a result.\n\nThe claim that she is saying the above statement in order to reduce grounds for an appeal by the Plaintiff or that somehow this is normal course and part of procedure to request something like that does not make sense or hold merit.  Our research seems to indicate quite to the contrary.  We do not believe preparing \"appropriate\" relief requests solely for the even of a remand would be related to any appellate arguments by the Plaintiffs nor is it a normal procedural requirement by the Court based on our research.\n\nWe believe now that the odds of a \"Remand\" are higher than not, and the primary question now remaining is whether the Judge will Remand with or without a vacatur or injunction in regards to the Record of Decision.\n\nTo gauge that, it will be helpful to understand the Defendant's arguments as it relates to the cited case (aka \"Rosemont\"):\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n[Bartell Ranch LLC v. McCullough, 3:21-cv-00080 – CourtListener.com](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/59247337/bartell-ranch-llc-v-mccullough/?filed_after=&filed_before=&entry_gte=&entry_lte=&order_by=desc)\n\nPreviously Lithium Americas in its August 11th Filings LAC argued the following (we have highlighted below what we think are the relevant segments the arguments):\n\n\" A. **BLM Complied with FLPMA, BLM Regulations & the RMP.**\n\nBased on inapplicable caselaw, ENGOs request a novel interpretation of FLPMA and a  `judicial repeal of BLM’s regulations that is procedurally barred`. The issue before this Court is whether BLM complied with FLPMA in approving exploration and use of lands with known  lithium throughout the Project area to develop critical minerals to meet our Nation’s needs. The  outcome ENGOs seek `would impermissibly repeal BLM’s longstanding regulations that differ substantially from those at issue in Rosemont`, where the Court remanded the case for the Forest  Service to determine whether its mining regulations apply. `ENGOs argue BLM was required to determine claim validity` but ignore that `BLM’s regulations do not require a validity determination on the Project lands and that the Court defers to BLM’s interpretation of the Mining Law`—particularly where that interpretation reflects Congressional intent to refrain from  requiring such a determination for permitting decisions. ECF 242 at 4–6. ENGOs do not respond  to Lithium Nevada’s observation that `they do not directly challenge BLM’s regulations` and any  such claim is waived. ECF 242 at 4 & n.5. `Any direct challenge2 to BLM’s regulations are time- barred under the statute of limitations`. Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Exp.-Import Bank of the  U.S., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111762, at \\*19 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 12, 2014) (“facial challenge to the  validity of an agency’s regulation on the ground that the agency exceeded constitutional or  statutory authority … `must be brought within six years after publication` ….”).\n\nThe `Rosemont decision` applies to National Forest System lands and `does not apply to projects on mineralized BLM lands because the agencies have different rules and statutory authorities governing surface uses at locatable mining projects`. The Rosemont Court ruled that the Forest  Service erroneously assumed the mining claims where waste rocks and tailings were to be stored  were valid where that “assumption \\[was\\] contradicted by the evidence.” Here, `BLM did not “assume” mining claim validity` because `BLM’s regulations are clear it had no authority to evaluate claim validity for a proposed Mine Plan of Operations (“MPO”) because the subject lands are neither segregated nor withdrawn from mineral entry`. 43 C.F.R. § 3809.100. Based on  inapplicable caselaw pertaining to unlawful, non-mining uses of mining claims or disputes  between rival locators, and a different statutory and regulatory framework governing mining  projects on Forest Lands, ENGOs request a novel and incorrect interpretation of FLPMA.\n\n**1. Rosemont Does Not Apply on Mineralized BLM Lands**\n\nContrary to the undisputed evidence in Rosemont that “no valuable minerals have been  found”—the record here is replete with `evidence of widespread lithium mineralization across the entire Project area`.4  ECF 242 at 6–10. ENGOs ignore Lithium Nevada’s record evidence of this  and focus on a `single figure from a 2018 Pre-Feasibility Study (“PFS”) that shows some “known zones of mineralization.”` This does not contradict the `record evidence showing mineralization throughout the Project`. The PFS was prepared under Canadian National Instrument 43-101  which defines how “mineralization” is used for seeking investments in a project (including at  the permitting and exploration stages). TPEIS-0234 AR033855. What the PFS identifies as  “known zones of mineralization” under Securities law is not equivalent to lands identified in the  that and other documents as “mineralized” under the Mining Law. This is demonstrated by the  text of the PFS itself which describes drilling results showing “continuous high grade sub\u0002horizontal … lithium across the project area.” AR033885.5\n\nENGOs ignore that even in Rosemont, the Court only discussed some “factual basis upon  which the Forest Service can determine rights.” 33 F.4th at 1229. Unlike the geologic facts in  Rosemont where lack of mineralization was “\\[u\\]ndisputed,” id. at 1221, this `Project’s evidence of mineralization is substantial and includes maps, drilling results, and multiple surveys`.6 Rosemont does not indicate that mineralization “appear\\[ing\\] throughout” is an insufficient  factual basis for BLM to recognize mineral rights,7  and ENGOs cite no other caselaw supporting  this bold jump. Notably, ENGOs themselves assert that their `proposed amendment to BLM’s regulations does not require BLM to conduct “a full claim validity examination,” but just a preliminary inquiry into mineralization. Pet. Attach. 5 at 4–5`.\n\nHere, ENGOs rely on inapposite cases determining property rights between competing claimants as establishing a requirement for validity determination,8  ECF 264 at 12, but neither  case cited deals with MPO approvals. Chrisman v. Miller, 197 U.S. 313, 323 (1905)  (“controversy \\[that\\] is between two mineral claimants”); United States v. Coleman, 390 U.S.  599, 600–01 (1968) (claim patent application). And in stark contrast to 1.9 billion tons of waste  rock in Rosemont, 33 F.4th at 1207, the waste rock expected here is only 190 million tons, FEIS  AR045799, split into two storage sites that will be re-vegetated allowing for similar pre- and  post-mining use of the area, id. at AR045562, AR046450. While the Rosemont Court concluded  the waste rock there could be stored on mill sites, that “solution” is inapplicable here because  Lithium Nevada cannot locate mill sites on mineralized lands, 30 U.S.C. §42, and `must mine waste rock incident to its mining operations, meaning under the applicable BLM regulations, the waste rock here must be stored on mining claims properly located on mineralized lands`.9\n\nThe Rosemont Court did not reach the issue of whether a validity determination or (as the  District Court concluded) “some consideration of mineralization” was required on mineralized  lands because it was unnecessary in Rosemont where “\\[u\\]ndisputed evidence in the record shows  that no valuable minerals have been found on Rosemont’s claims.” 33 F.4th at 1212. The  Rosemont decision does not authorize, much less require, that this Court rewrite BLM’s  permitting and surface use regulations that were not even considered by the Rosemont Court.\n\n**2. Earthworks—not Rosemont—is the Relevant Precedent**\n\nENGOs ignore the recent relevant precedent from Earthworks v. DOI, 496 F. Supp. 3d 472  (D.D.C. 2020), which considered an ongoing challenge to BLM’s 43 C.F.R. Part 3809  Regulations and held that `claims of unknown validity (that have not undergone a validity exam) must be presumed valid`. As noted by Earthworks, validity determinations take years. Id. at 493.  Imposing such a `new requirement on BLM would inject unnecessary permitting delays to producing critical minerals in conflict with Congress’s directives`, our Nation’s needs,11 and more  than forty years of BLM’s application of its 3809 regulations12 to authorize locatable mineral  projects during which BLM has not conducted validity determinations except when required  pursuant to 43 CFR § 3809.100.13 Congress has acknowledged its agreement with BLM’s  regulations not requiring claim validity determinations for MPO approvals unless lands are  segregated or withdrawn—had Congress disapproved, it would have required such  determinations when it amended the Mining Law to require annual claims maintenance fees  regardless of discovery status. 14 30 U.S.C. § 28j(c) (1993).\n\n**3. BLM regulations govern surface use and occupancy at mining  projects under FLPMA**\n\nENGOs contend that Rosemont “rejected the same position taken by” Lithium Nevada here,  but `Rosemont involved a challenge of the Forest Service’s assumption that claims were “valid” absent any evidence of mineralization on those claims`. Because there were no known minerals  on the claims in Rosemont, 33 F.4th at 1221, the Court deemed claim validity irrelevant.  Furthermore, the same requirements do not apply to both agencies, ECF 264 at 9, because `BLM only considers validity for MPO approval if the project is proposed on lands segregated or withdrawn from mineral entry`. ECF 242 at 3–4; 43 C.F.R. §3809.100. BLM’s 3809 regulations  discuss required MPO elements, but do not mandate a particular discovery status of the subject  mining claim. Id. Conversely, the Service does not even have regulations governing “claims that  embrace segregated or withdrawn lands.” 83 Fed. Reg. 46451, 46457 (Sept. 13, 2018). Rosemont considered whether the Service applied the correct regulation, Part 228A or Section 251. Here  ENGOs do not claim BLM should have used a different regulation—they seek to invalidate  BLM’s regulations without ever stating such a claim in their complaint (which would be time  barred in any event). ECF 1 at 5. The Forest System lands in Rosemont were not governed by  specific regulations defining “use” and “occupancy for hardrock mining projects.15 In contrast,  under FLPMA, BLM promulgated Surface Use and Occupancy regulations, 43 C.F.R. § 3715.0- 5, which define waste rock storage facilities as “use,” and define “occupancy” to mean “full or  part-time residence on the public lands.” The surface management requirements of 43 C.F.R.  Part 3800 govern the uses that are reasonably incident.16 The Rosemont decision did not consider  and does not apply to BLM’s regulations governing use17 of public lands under FLPMA.\n\nNor did Rosemont consider or decide BLM’s implementation of FLPMA. FLPMA explicitly  notes that “\\[a\\]ll actions by the Secretary concerned under this Act shall be subject to valid  existing rights.” 43 U.S.C. § 1712(e)(3). Because `Lithium Nevada’s mineralized claims are presumptively valid and do not require a validity determination, FLPMA’s application does not impair the Project or BLM’s regulations`. ECF 242 at 6, 11. Rosemont did not require a validity  determination because it deemed the nonmineralized claims invalid and did not analyze the  interplay between FLPMA and BLM’s regulations. The `Ninth Circuit recognizes the distinction between BLM’s and the Service’s regulations`,18 U.S. v. Richardson, 599 F.2d 290, 294 (9th Cir.  1979), and here the Court’s `only consideration (were it to question the regulations) is “whether the agency’s reading of the regulations is reasonable and whether the regulations are not unduly vague.”` Irvington Moore v. OSHRC, 556 F.2d 431, 435 (9th Cir. 1977).\n\nBLM’s regulations harmonize FLPMA and other applicable Federal statutes. When Congress  amended the Mining Law in the 1955 Surface Use Act, it did not limit the use of mining claims  for just the mine pit but expressly allowed uses reasonably incident to mining. ECF 242 at 8.19 The `Ninth Circuit recognizes BLM’s post-Surface Use Act regulations (which did not require validity determinations) as allowing any activity on BLM lands “directly related to mining.”`20 Richardson, 599 F.2d at 294. BLM developed its Surface Use and Occupancy regulations under  FLPMA and other relevant Federal laws to implement Congress’ directives regarding allowable  mining uses on public lands and encouraging development of critical minerals.\n\nUnder FLPMA, BLM has distinctly defined “occupancy” and “use.” While the Surface Use  Act (“Section 612”) did not expand rights under Section 22 of the Mining Law, Section 612  clarified what surface uses are allowed under the Mining Law—anything “reasonably incident”  to mining, 30 U.S.C.S. § 612(a). `BLM thus properly applied its 3809 regulations to this Project’s waste rock storage sites, as uses that are “reasonably incident and do not involve occupancy.”`  Use and Occupancy Under the Mining Law - Final Rule, 61 Fed. Reg. 37116, 37118 (July 16,  1996). `On BLM lands, occupancy is defined as “activities that involve residence” and BLM explained that occupancy in this Project would consist of a process facility, administration office, and wells—not waste rock storage`. FEIS AR045839. Thus, `waste rock placement on mining claims constitutes “reasonably incident” use for mining operations`. Cf. Koenig, 4 IBLA 18, 19,  21 (1971) (roads necessary to mining activities needed “no authorization” from BLM to build);  W. Shoshone Def. Project, 160 IBLA 32, 55–56 (2003) (rejecting plaintiff’s argument that “claim  validity” must be part of BLM’s analysis of an \\[MPO\\]” the Board noted “`BLM generally does not determine the validity of the affected mining claims before approving a plan of operations`”).\n\n**4. The Plain Language of the RMPA FEIS Exempts “Locatable  Mineral Development.”**\n\nENGOs re-argue that BLM must apply every aspect of the RMP without regard to “valid  existing rights”—ignoring that the 2015 RMPA FEIS itself21 states that its “\\[s\\]tipulations do not  apply to locatable mineral development” consistent with BLM’s longstanding regulations. ECF  242, Ex. 1 at 3-139 to 3-140. ENGOs do not respond to Lithium Nevada’s argument that where  the RMP defines “valid existing rights” as including “mineral rights,” the RMP does not equate  “mineral rights” to “valid claims.” ECF 242 at 3. ENGOs instead argue that this language  represents an incorrect view of the Mining Law and point to Rosemont. But `Rosemont does not address FLPMA, BLM regulations, BLM land, or RMPs at all`. Nor did ENGOs bring any claim  in this case challenging the RMPA, meaning such challenges are waived. `ENGOs argue that BLM must enforce the RMPA`, but then disregard specific portions of it they don’t like. The  `RMPA is valid and controlling because this Court did not vacate the FEIS in Western Exploration LLC v. United States`, 250 F. Supp. 3d 718, 750 (D. Nev. 2017).22\n\n**5. ENGOs’ approach contravenes Acts to Address the Domestic Needs  for Critical Minerals**\n\n`ENGOs’ novel mandate that BLM determine claim validity for MPO approvals is unfounded in statute, regulation, or caselaw`, and would frustrate Congressional directives to eliminate  delays in permitting critical mineral projects. In December 2020, `Congress amended the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research and Development Act of 1980 to require Federal agencies such as BLM “minimize delays in … the issuance of permits and authorizations necessary to explore for, develop, and produce critical minerals.”`23 30 U.S.C. § 1602(8). This  recent Act confirmed prior directives to “promote an adequate and stable supply of materials  necessary to maintain national security, economic well-being and industrial production.” Id.  §§ 1602; 21a. The Project’s importance in producing lithium to meet National security and  energy needs is undisputed.24 BLM’s regulations properly implement FLPMA, the Mining Law  and Congress’ repeated and recent directives to encourage domestic mineral development,  especially for critical minerals such as lithium. `ENGOs’ requested relief would repeal BLM’s valid regulations and frustrate past and current Congressional directives to encourage domestic mining`.25 ENGOs’ requested relief would undermine Congress’ directive to BLM to find  efficiencies in permitting and instead bog down the process with needless delay to satisfy a  judicially-created rule to determine validity prior to approval, a process that would add years of  delay. BLM acknowledged in a 2007 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking “validity examinations”  for all mining claims were impractical and that declining to do so was consistent with the Mining  Law and FLPMA, `“[b]ecause Congress authorizes mining claimants to locate mining claims under the Mining Law and maintain them by making annual payments to the BLM while the validity of the claims is unknown or undetermined.”`26 Earthworks, 496 F. Supp. 3d at 483.  \"\n\nIn separate filing from August 11th, Lithium Americas had a footnote #58:\n\n*\"While this Court remanded the ARMPA for NEPA violations, it did not vacate the ROD. W.

But the `Ninth Circuit observed that “[r]emand without vacatur is common,” Nat’l Family Farm Coal. v. EPA`, 966 F.3d 893, 930 (9th Cir. 2020), and the frequency  is irrelevant: `vacatur “depends on how serious the agency’s errors are and the disruptive consequences of an interim change`.” 350 Mont. v. Haaland, 29 F.4th 1158, 1177 (9th Cir. 2022).  The Court must `consider the “environmental, economic, and energy-related consequences of vacatur`.” Id. Remand without vacatur is `appropriate in circumstances beyond undesirable environmental consequences`. Pac. Rivers v. U.S., 942 F. Supp. 2d 1014, 1018 (E.D. Cal. 2013)  (it is “not correct” to `withhold vacatur “only in situations where environmental harm is likely to flow from” vacatur`). The disruptive `consequences and harms to Lithium Nevada, its employees, surrounding communities, and the Nation would be severe`, ECF 242 at 38-40. The `alleged errors are minimal; BLM could substantiate its decision on remand`. The economic and energy-related  concerns at stake are grave: current and future jobs, financial investment, and lithium our Nation  desperately needs.53 Id. The `ROD should not be vacated because it would create “a disruptive,” “expensive” consequence harmful to the public`. Pac. Rivers, 942 F. Supp. 2d at 1022.  \"\n\nThe BLM as Defendants also reiterated the same request as LAC on one of their August 11th filings regarding a \"remand without vacatur\":\n\n\" Even assuming that Rosemont applied here and BLM was required to assess the  validity of Lithium Nevada’s mining claims in approving the Project, `the record here contains evidence supporting the potential for valuable minerals—lithium— throughout the Thacker Pass basin`. Bartell acknowledges the FEIS’s recognition that  there is “\\[l\\]ithium mineralization” in the “lacustrine sediments of the McDermitt  Caldera.” Bartell Reply at 37 (citing TPEIS-0384 at page 579, which is the same as  TPEIS-0702, FEIS App’x G at AR-065693). Even `if the record contained conflicting evidence about the viability of extraction, at most, that the Court should not make a determination—as the Ninth Circuit did—that Lithium Nevada’s claims are invalid`.  Rather, `if it finds any error on this basis, it should remand the decision to BLM to make the appropriate findings and determinations in the first instance`. \"\n\nThe BLM then also goes on to say in a separate August 11th filing:\n\n\" **III. The Court should not vacate the ROD and EIS**\n\nAs explained above, the record demonstrates that the Project’s approval  complied with applicable law and was not arbitrary or capricious, so no remedy is  called for here. But should the Court grant Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment  and conclude that the Project’s approval was insufficient in some aspect, the `ROD and FEIS should not be vacated`.  Under the APA “\\[t\\]he reviewing court shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside  agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an  abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  Ultimately, however, `“[t]he decision whether to vacate depends on the seriousness of the order’s deficiencies (and thus the extent of doubt whether the agency chose correctly) and the disruptive consequences of an interim change that may itself be changed.”` Allied–Signal, Inc. v. U.S. Nuclear Regul. Comm’n, 988 F.2d 146, 150-51  (D.C. Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, `“when equity demands,” the challenged agency action can be “‘left in place while the agency follows the necessary procedures’ to correct its action.”` Cal. Cmtys. Against Toxics v.  EPA, 688 F.3d 989, 992 (9th Cir. 2012) (per curiam) (quoting Idaho Farm Bureau Fed’n  v. Babbitt, 58 F.3d 1392, 1405 (9th Cir. 1995)). Equity so demands, for example, where  vacatur would “lead to impermissibly disruptive consequences in the interim.” Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 282 F. Supp. 3d 91, 97 (D.D.C.  2017) (citing Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Co. v. FERC, 519 F.3d 497, 504 (D.C.  Cir. 2008).\n\n`Vacatur is also “not appropriate” where “nothing in the record indicates[,] that on remand the agency will necessarily fail to justify its decisions . . . .”` WildEarth  Guardians v.

It should thus afford the parties an opportunity to address those specific questions through further,  focused briefing.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nFrom the Plaintiff's perspective, per Bartell's July 12, 2022 filing, the Plaintiffs will likely continue to argue that the BLM permitted LAC to occupy areas outside of the McDermitt caldera where lithium is not found:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7sd9cakhf84a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d67d3aa50df04487f60fed45a675ccae9ab80e9\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on all the above, if we believe there is a higher probability than not of the court remanding, (which we do based on Judge Du's most recent filing and the technical arguments made), then the primary question that remains is whether the court will remand with or without vacatur or injunction.\n\nWe agree with Lithium Americas that a Remand with a vacatur or injunction would be disruptive.\n\nAs such, we have exited our position in Lithium Americas for now and will likely reinvest at some point in the future pending the results from the January 5th, 2023 hearing or possibly after a final decision is rendered to allow the opportunity to understand if a vacatur or injunction is pending or not (or even if we are right or wrong about a Remand).\n\nWhile we believe the probabilities of a Remand is higher than not, we also believe a \"Remand without vacatur\" is possible.  We will continue to discuss this matter in our Whatsapp chat group (which we invite all LAC investors to join for free).\n\nWe also believe that LAC is trading near its floor value based on the anticipated Cauchari Olaroz production, but we do not believe that a Remand to the BLM with Vacatur will provide support for favorable movements in the stock price for some time to come until the deficiency is fixed.\n\nA remand with vacatur or injunction, in particular, has the potential to significantly delay the construction start of Thacker Pass (e.g., pushing the construction start date out to 2024).  It would would reset the timeline, open up the doors to potential further appeals on Thacker Pass, and possibly disrupt any loan applications that may have been in process with either or both the DOEs and/or any agreements/negotiations that may be in play with Strategic Partners.\n\nWe look forward to the possibility of a \"Remand without vacatur\" or even a \"Remand with injunction\" (which may delay things a little while deficiencies are cured) and to returning to our investment in LAC someday soon in what we still believe is a great prospect for this country and a potentially great opportunity as an investor.\n\nWhile we realize that this perspective may be upsetting or in opposition to other shareholder's perspective, we try to remain objective in our stock analyses in sharing both positive and negative news on Lithium Americas and choosing to publish our views to this to that extent.  We believe it was the right and transparent thing to do, and we hope you respect (if not agree).\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

    "title": "Politics and Thacker Pass Project",
    "selftext": "Hi folks, happy new year! First off, want to be clear this post isn't intended to be about my own or anyone else's political beliefs. However, to the extent that our current US political climate has an impact on the larger economy and certainly the Thacker Pass Project, I wanted to share a few thoughts about the potentially forthcoming loan from the Department of Energy in the context of national and state politics. We are all probably aware that DOE and Lithium Americas have said that funding the loan will be announced by late 2023 (already past) or early 2024, but that timeline could be impacted by several pertinent factors I describe below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **A looming government shutdown would likely delay the announcement of the loan.**\n\nProbably more so than any other factor, a government shutdown beginning in late January or early February would delay the final announcement of funding the loan. Under funding deals passed earlier this year, a partial shutdown would begin for some agencies as soon as January 19th and a full shutdown by February 2nd. DOE would be affected by a partial shutdown beginning January 19th. In that scenario, DOE would not be operating and certainly would not be announcing new funding for projects. Additionally, the focus of the current Administration and Congress would likely completely shift focus to reopening the government to avoid the disruptions it causes across the economy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Nevada's upcoming Presidential primary may push DOE to announce the loan to coincide with early voting.**\n\nEarly voting for Nevada's presidential primary begins Saturday January 27th and will conclude on February 6th. Given that the federal support Thacker Pass may be receiving from the DOE is part of this Administration's efforts to promote infrastructure development and domestic production of lithium to support electric vehicles, there could be a political impetus to the DOE announcing the funding for the loan to coincide with the beginning of early voting. The coinciding media attention for the potentially historic investment in Nevada and domestic energy production would remind voters of the accomplishments of the current Administration, and contrast the approach with the opposing party threatening to shutdown the government. Presumably, if the DOE is going to announce funding the loan before the primary and before a looming shut then it would need to happen between now and January 19th.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **I don't predict an announcement until at least February and after the shutdown threat subsides.**\n\nRegardless of the likelihood of a full or partial government shutdown, I think the mere possibility is sucking a lot of attention from the higher-ups across the government in DC. As such, major announcements are probably being postponed until after the shutdown threat subsides. Also, from my experience, big announcements from government agencies usually come with press conferences and appearances from elected officials, which I don't see happening anytime soon on the heels of a potential shutdown.\n\nI'm curious what other folks think about these political factors affecting the development of this project and whether they ultimately will impact stock price. I'm optimistic that if the loan is hopefully approved, it'll be reflected in investor confidence in this project and ultimately lead to a rise in stock price in the longer-term. In the near term, I think whatever happens with the government shutdown can lead to some swings in the stock market generally and maybe LAC in particular. In any case, hoping to make a few bucks from all of it haha. ",

    "selftext": "Recently,\n\nRepublican Senator Tom Cotton (from Arkansas), put out a piece stoking unfounded fears about Lithium America:\n\n[Cotton Demands Answers on Partially Chinese-Owned Lithium Mine Potentially Receiving U.S. Funding (senate.gov)](https://www.cotton.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cotton-demands-answers-on-partially-chinese-owned-lithium-mine-potentially-receiving-us-funding)\n\nWhile I don't agree with Senator Cotton on his characterizations of LAC being a Chinese owned company, I did want to highlight one statement in his letter to the Department of Energy:\n\n\" *DOE’s loan for the Thacker Pass mine would be substantial and reportedly cover the majority of the project’s capital costs.* \"\n\nHis role on the Joint Economic committee would give him access to information that would seem to backup and support that statement.\n\nThis is important in that the DOE loan (which is most likely funded from the $3.16Bn approved previously by the current administration - which may be why Senator Cotton is against it, even though the Thacker Pass mine was originally approved under the Republican administration) :\n\n[Biden Administration Announces $3.16 Billion from Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to Boost Domestic Battery Manufacturing and Supply Chains | Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-administration-announces-316-billion-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-boost-domestic) )\n\nis covering the majority of the Thacker Pass project's capital cost would open the door to several opportunities:\n\n1. It provides Senior secured Fixed Rate US Treasury Debt at one of the lowest cost rates of financing, US Treasury Rates, (low single digits) with no credit spread and with long tenors available and flexible structures.\n2. It solidifies Funding for the TP project (if you track Lasonde curves, this is a value creation segment for any mining company).  This alone would catapult the stock down the La Sonde curve which is a large section of the total value creation.\n3. It reduces/ and possibly eliminates any equity dilution to LAC from either raising capital from other investors or strategic partners (which is what is normal for capital raises of this size for other mining companies)\n4. It potentially establishes a longer relationship with the DOE / Government for funding of future expansions on faceplate capacity/production in the TP/Caldera resource or the development of an additional mine(s) as previously announced by LAC [www.reddit.com/r/LithiumAmerica/comments/wsf06o/lithium\\_americas\\_considering\\_building\\_a\\_second/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LithiumAmerica/comments/wsf06o/lithium_americas_considering_building_a_second/)  (e.g., and/or in collaboration with Green Tech Metals: [www.reddit.com/r/LithiumAmerica/comments/xj1klj/lithium\\_americas\\_and\\_green\\_metals\\_enter\\_into/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LithiumAmerica/comments/xj1klj/lithium_americas_and_green_metals_enter_into/))\n5. In addition, with the recent announcement of intentions to do \"vertical integration\", the DOE may also be a source of additional funding as it fits with the loan strategy outlined by the Biden Administration and it would take advantage of the Inflation Reduction Act.\n6. Potentially will lead to off-take agreements with the government or other US entities\n7. It may accelerate development plans help ensure a production start of 2025/2026\n8. This would also free up the war chest currently on LAC's balance sheet to be allocated in large part for the development of the new South American projects (e.g., Pastos Grandes project; Arena Minerals)\n\nHere is a link to an FAQ sheet regarding the ATVM Loan Program:\n\n[www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2020/01/f70/DOE-LPO-ATVM-Jan2020.pdf](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2020/01/f70/DOE-LPO-ATVM-Jan2020.pdf)\n\nAs part of the process, LAC is most likely at the end of phase 3: the \"Due Diligence & Negotiation phase\" (which was originally begun 6 months ago) and will likely get to a \"conditional commitment offer\" at the end or may already have it in place. My guess, they parallel tracked the negotiation of loan documents in anticipation of Judge Du's decision and are now in a holding pattern waiting on Judge Du's decision.  I expect the loan approval will be announced in Q4'22 along with the spin-off/divestiture/separation of the North American and South American assets.\n\n[(2) Lithium Americas Submits Formal Application for Department of Energy ATVM Loan Program : LithiumAmerica (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LithiumAmerica/comments/u3nnef/lithium_americas_submits_formal_application_for/)\n\nGoing back to our illustrious Senator Cotton, we must remember that he is the Senator for Arkansas, which is home to one of Lithium Americas' largest competitors, \"Standard Lithium\".  I suspect his choice to champion this \"altruistic\" cause against LAC may be related to that:\n\n[Arkansas Smackover :: Standard Lithium Ltd. (SLI)](https://www.standardlithium.com/projects/arkansas-smackover)\n\nI hope this helps put something in context as to why inane comments from Senator Cotton can actually reflect a gem of opportunity for LAC.\n\nI truly believe (of course I could be wrong) that we are days or weeks away from a decision by Judge Du).  Judge Du previously had indicated a decision by the end of the third quarter (which is this Friday).  LAC has indicated the end of the quarter or \"shortly thereafter\".  If we believe that Judge Du would make a decision within 60 days (i.e., two months) of the August 11th filings, then that would place us at around October 11th for a decision.\n\nThere is no guarantee that she will side with the BLM or the plaintiffs, but my review of the documents leads me to believe that Thacker Pass will be allowed to go forward.\n\nWe are getting close to a conclusion of a long and winding road (IMHO).\n\nI Hope that helps and GLTA,\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to\n\n1.

Updated LiCarbonate Volumes: Currently 600k to 700k tonnes per annum produced/demanded globally per annum \n2. Updated Forecast: 2030 expect 5x that amount (3MM to 3.5MM tonnes per annum)\n3. Mines: 10 years to develop a mine (especially in US); shortest is 5 years and can be up to 20 years (or never)\n4. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA signed in August): Helps on Demand but does not do anything for permitting\n5. IRA: There is an incentive to build facilities in the US (e.g., by European and particularly Asian manufacturers who are looking to build in US with private capital to take advantage of the tax credits from domestic production).\n6. Auto Makers are approaching companies like LAC to lock up lithium production\n7. There is not much in the way of refining in US (should be co-located at the same site rather than shipping all over the world).  There is only 1 active lithium mining company producing and 3 refining operations in the US.\n8. The most important item for me was the tag line towards the end of the video interview saying \"Lithium Americas Domestic Production Project Begins Production This Year\"  (presumes an affirmation by Judge Du on the RoD)\n9. The Project in Nevada is designed to be carbon neutral: Most heat is captured from waste heat and generates half of electricity needed, and wheel in hydro power from the colombian river valley; recycle 85% of the water used in the process\n\nHope that helps,\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

Judge Du denied the Plaintiffs Motion (specifically, the extra-record evidence admission) due to it being based on post-decisional information/content.\n2. Judge Du appears to be eager to wrap things up soon (\"As repeatedly stated in prior orders, the Court hopes to get to the merits review of this case, not ceaselessly litigate the scope and content of the administrative record).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cons:**\n\n1. She acknowledges that there is an environmental impact for purposes of establishing that Bartell has Standing  (\"No party seriously disputes that this outcome would be more beneficial for the environment immediately surrounding the Project\") and granted prudential standing to Bartell Ranch\n2. She used tonal language that reprimanded LAC for filing \"motions to strike \\[that\\] are a waste of time\".\n\nWe believe Judge Du's tone and attitude in the report is one of exasperation and she is looking to finish this case as soon as possible.

    "title": "ARENA MINERALS COMPLETES POND CONSTRUCTION (10/12/22)",
    "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nThe following is a press release from Arena Minerals (of which Lithium Americas is a 17.4% minority investor and strategic collaborator on - along with Ganfeng Lithium).  The collaboration stems from the shared project Pastos Grandes basin (i.e., LAC owns a portion obtained from the acquisition of Millenial Lithium and Arena owns a neighboring portion).  There may be opportunity to share facilities/infrastructure and also R&D as it relates to the soil composition and processing.\n\nMost noteworthy is the in-situ design Arena has developed and lack of power and water consumption need (to the point of a near zero carbon footprint - see below):\n\n[arenaminerals.com/arena-minerals-completes-pond-construction/](https://arenaminerals.com/arena-minerals-completes-pond-construction/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**Toronto, Canada: Arena Minerals Inc. (“Arena”** **or the** **“Company”) (TSX-V: AN | OTCQX: AMRZF)** is pleased to announce evaporation pond construction has been completed at its Sal de la Puna Project (“SDLP Project”) located in the Pastos Grandes basin within Salta province, Argentina. The evaporation pilot pond covers a total of 10,000 m2 and has been filled with raw brine from the Almafuerte claim block. The evaporation pond has been designed to produce >35% lithium chloride (“LiCl”) (6% lithium) from SDLP raw brine.\n\nThe pilot pond was built according to engineering **design utilizing only in-situ material**. Soil mechanics showed favourable parameters such as soil type, particle size distribution and compaction properties making the Blanca Lila formation, which covers most of Almafuerte and Graciela claim blocks, an attractive site for the construction of a production complex. The favourable soil conditions eliminated the need for geotextile layers under the liner, **reducing the overall cost of construction**. The pond has been filled to operating brine height with Pastos Grandes raw brine averaging 558 mg/l Li. A permanent salt floor is being deposited over the liner to protect the liner during harvesting. Once the permanent salt floor design thickness has been reached design specifications, internal walls shall be constructed using waste sodium chloride covered with HDPE.\n\nEduardo Morales, Executive Chairman of Arena, commented, “We are extremely pleased with progress to date at SDLP. Construction of the ponds was completed on schedule and budget, setting a solid foundation for the completion of detailed engineering of commercial sized ponds. We are in the process of selecting engineering firms for the **design of a 40,000 tonne per annum lithium chloride** facility, which will incorporate the results of an economic assessment including capital and operating cost estimates.”\n\nAn aerial image of the completed pond prior to filling with SDLP brine can be found below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i40zhadd0et91.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=6280f24b0f0e4b25a1b3a7822b13acd7c7a0f683\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Environmental, Social & Governance Update**\n\nSince the acquisition of the Sal de la Puna project Arena has developed a healthy relationship with local communities. The strength and support shown by the local communities for the Project is also a testament to the long-standing relationships existing with Arena’s operations team, many of whom have been operating in the immediate region for over a decade.\n\nArena’s business model and processing approach provides an environmentally friendly and sustainable alternative to the more conventional liming process that traditionally requires a chemical plant on site. In aiming to produce >35% LiCl directly from ponds, Arena does not require a more environmentally sensitive liming plant while minimizing the use (to **almost zero consumption) of both power and fresh water** thus reducing our carbon footprint. The Arena process is **powered by solar energy (evaporation) and does not employ fresh water**. The only power and water required is for the camp and minor ancillary services, such as pumping. Like most lithium brine projects in the Puna region of Argentina, Sal de la Puna is located in a high-altitude desert where both power and water are scarce commodities.\n\nA **production Environmental Impact Study (“EIS”) has been submitted to the mining authorities in Salta for the permitting of a 40,000 tonne per annum lithium chloride facility**. The study evaluates the impact of constructing 490 hectares of lined evaporation ponds, thirteen production wells, and related ancillary infrastructure on the Almafuerte and Graciela claim blocks. These claim blocks are primarily covered by the Blanca Lila geological formation where the 1-hectare pilot pond has been constructed with favourable results. The lithium bearing aquifers targeted by the well field are interpreted as hydraulically separate from any surface waters and therefore of minimal impact\n\nto the basin habitats. The Company is working closely with the authorities on minimizing any potential impacts in a timely manner while ensuring the local communities and provincial governments benefit from value-add lithium products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**About Arena Minerals Inc.**\n\nArena owns 65% of the Sal de la Puna Project covering approximately 13,200 hectares of the Pastos Grandes basin located in Salta, Argentina. The claims are highly prospective and share the basin with two advanced lithium brine projects. In addition to Sal de la Puna, the Company owns the Antofalla lithium brine project in Argentina, consisting of four claims covering a total of 6,000 hectares of the central portion of Salar de Antofalla, located immediately south of Albemarle Corporation’s Antofalla project. Arena has developed a proprietary brine processing technology using brine type reagents derived from the Antofalla project with the objective of producing more competitive battery grade lithium products.\n\nArena also owns 80 percent of the Atacama Copper property within the Antofagasta region of Chile, and 5.8 million shares of Astra Exploration. The projects are at low altitudes, within producing mining camps in infrastructure-rich areas, located in the heart of Chile’s premier copper mining district.\n\nFor more information regarding the Company, its management, expertise, and projects, please visit [www.arenaminerals.com](http://www.arenaminerals.com).

I, personally believe a favorable ruling coupled with announcements for buy-off contracts will result in a parabolic rise for LAC.  Its painful to sit by and watch with no news from the legal front and what I consider to be suspect news from GS.\n\nAny thoughts?  (I am long on LAC)",

    "selftext": "# [electrek.co/2022/11/01/eu-us-exemption-evs-from-european-members-in-us-tax-credits/](https://electrek.co/2022/11/01/eu-us-exemption-evs-from-european-members-in-us-tax-credits/)\n\n# EU and US discussing an exemption that would include EVs from European members in US tax credits\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/of8pr8jb1g0a1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c545dcd14a1fe731d7d0e22eff8e154839f634b\n\nThe European Union has asked the [United States](http://v/) to include EVs, batteries, and other sustainable products sold on US soil in federal tax credits, similar to benefits it currently offers its North American neighbors. According to a recent report, the US and EU are in discussions about what’s possible.\n\nA large prompter in the US reaching a critical mass point of EV adoption has been the federal and state tax credits in place for electric vehicles and their charging infrastructure. Depending on the vehicle, a person’s filing status, and annual income, [US taxpayers can qualify for up to $7,500](https://electrek.co/2022/08/21/which-electric-vehicles-still-qualify-for-us-federal-tax-credit/#h-what-electric-vehicles-qualify-under-the-previous-tax-credit) back at the end of the fiscal year, not to mention additional [exemptions available at the state level](https://electrek.co/2022/10/05/ev-tax-credit-rebate-states-electric-vehicles/).\n\nUS automakers like Tesla and GM surpassed the 200,000 unit threshold for EV sales years ago, thus disqualifying them from tax credits, while plenty of EVs from European automakers still qualified. Since taking office, the Biden administration has been [adamant about expanding electrification](https://electrek.co/2022/10/19/biden-to-award-2-8-billion-in-support-of-us-ev-battery-and-mineral-production/) and electrical grid support throughout the US, [including federal fleets](http://v/), school buses, and passenger mobility.\n\nThis past August, President Biden signed what could be one of the most noteworthy pieces of legislation in his presidential legacy with [the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)](https://electrek.co/2022/08/15/biden-will-sign-inflation-reduction-act-tomorrow-affecting-ev-credits/). The bill extends federal tax credits through 2032, slashes the 200K unit threshold, and promotes North American EV manufacturing.\n\nAs one would imagine, European countries and their automakers have been less excited about new tax credit terms under the IRA, including the requirement that the vehicles, their batteries, and the majority of battery components must be built in North America.\n\nNow, those European countries are speaking up and are asking the US to once again include its EVs in the revised tax credits, despite the pro-North American assembly terms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f28869gj1g0a1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f621681dea63bfe6790d0e235696a9a89428fee\n\n## Could European EVs soon qualify for US tax credits?\n\nPossibly! According to a report from *Automotive News Europe*, the prospect of European EVs qualifying for tax credits in the US is [at least being discussed](https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/eu-asks-us-same-ev-treatment-canada-and-mexico?utm_source=daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=20221101&utm_content=article3-readmore). Czech trade minister Jozef Sikela said the European Union has asked the US to treat its member’s EVs, batteries, and other charging equipment as it would for Mexico and Canada, qualifying for revised tax credits.\n\nAs members of North America sharing a border with the United States, one could argue Mexico and Canada are more incentivized to support US production and commerce and are, thus, worthy of credits. The EU argues otherwise, stating that the Inflation Reduction Act [discriminates against European automakers](https://electrek.co/2022/10/13/europe-says-the-inflation-reduction-act-isnt-fair-play/) and other manufacturers.\n\nAt its core, the revised terms of [federal tax credits](https://electrek.co/2022/10/31/which-electric-vehicles-still-qualify-for-us-federal-tax-credit/) in the IRA are not necessarily to keep certain countries or automakers out but to promote manufacturing and supply chains in the US and its neighboring countries. The EU’s counter to that argument is that it currently offers the same tax credits for EVs and their materials, regardless if they’re made in the EU or US.\n\nSikela, whose home country currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU, was part of a recent meeting in Prague between EU trade ministers and US Trade Representative Katherine Tai. Following the meeting, Sikela said there was a willingness on both sides to reach some form of a deal that would qualify European EVs for US tax credits.\n\nTo what extent a potential deal may bring EU products remains unclear, but Sikela is already managing expectations:\n\n>**We are expecting a derogation (in the US IRA) for EU member states – ideally we would like to have the same as Canada and Mexico, but we have to be realistic and see what we can negotiate.**\n\nEU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said a task force will meet for the first time this week to assist in solving the issue. He followed up by saying:\n\n>**We are focusing on a negotiated solution before we move on to other considerations.**\n\nThe new terms for federal tax credits in the US will kick in on January 1, 2023, and will affect many local automakers as well as those in European countries. More to come on this story as it develops.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

There is a delay in first production to sometime in First half of 2023\n2. First production will likely not be technical grade, due to the purification elements not being complete, but will be complete sometime in first half of 2023 to start battery grade production then\n3. 2023 Volumes expected to be >15kt\n4. 2024 Volumes will be under 40ktpa but closer to that level\n5. Offtake agreements already exist for most of production volumes which will be priced at market indices\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Thacker Pass:**\n\n1. Oral Arguments scheduled for January 5th\n2. Decision is expected soon after according to management\n3. The decision and outcome remain uncertain but the outcome remains key for the project and the company\n4. Only after that is done will an asset spin-off occur\n5. It will likely take about a 6-month process after clarity is given (again it is unclear at this stage whether there will be an Affirmation, a remand with vacatur, a remand with injunction, or a remand with no vacatur or injunction, or possibly some other option)\n6. A strategic partner will be announced following a decision on the project (assuming an affirmative decision is reached)\n7.

    "selftext": "Analyst Note Seth Goldstein, CFA, Strategist on November 3rd, 2022 put out the following Morningstar Update after the announcement of the Lithium Americas Spinoff: \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**No Changes to Our Outlook as Lithium Americas Announces Spinoff Plan; Shares Materially Undervalued** \n\n On Nov. 3, Lithium Americas announced that it plans to separate the company into two distinct businesses based on geography by spinning off its North American assets. After reviewing the deal, we see no reason to change to our forecast. We therefore **maintain our fair value estimate $65** (CAD 88) and no-moat rating. At current prices, we view shares of Lithium Americas as severely undervalued, **trading more than 60% below our fair value estimate**. \n\nThe deal will see current shareholders issued shares of the newly created North American company (that will be named Lithium Americas), while retaining shares in the current company (that will be renamed Lithium International). The company's Argentina-based assets will be included in Lithium International. This will hold the company's 44.8% stake in Chauchari-Olaroz, full ownership of Pastos Grandes, and minority investment in Arena Minerals. The new company (which will retain the Lithium Americas name) will hold Thacker Pass and the minority investments in Green Technology Metals Limited and Ascend Elements. Management plans for the separation to be completed by the end of 2023. \n\nWhile we maintain our fair value estimate, **we agree with the strategical decision to split the businesses**. We think the **separation of the businesses will benefit each project** as they are in permitting and construction as they **focus on more localized markets**. This should allow each company to more  easily obtain financing for its projects under development instead of having multiple projects compete for capital. Along these lines, Thacker Pass is currently awaiting approval for the **Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program** (ATVM). We think **approval is more likely for a U.S.-based company**. The ATVM is a **low-cost loan program that would fund 50%-60% Thacker Pass' phase 1 capital expenditures**. This would provide Lithium Americas with **one of the lowest-cost financing sources** available. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe echo Morningstar's sentiments (see link below for In the Ruff Research's analysis and thoughts on the Spinoff): \n\n[www.reddit.com/r/LithiumAmerica/comments/yl4vl1/analysis\\_of\\_the\\_news\\_announcement\\_lithium/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LithiumAmerica/comments/yl4vl1/analysis_of_the_news_announcement_lithium/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

    "selftext": "I recently noticed a series of \"back and forth\" exchanges on another board regarding whether the BLM / LAC would have to start another RoD process (i.e., starting from scratch) if Judge Du did not affirm the original RoD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBased on my own research, the answer is \"not necessarily\":\n\nWe can reference the NEPA Report on their process: \n\n[https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47205](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47205)\n\nYou can see in the report (link above) on Page 9 there is a section that specifically states:\n\n\"Courts have created an equitable exception, sometimes ordering remand without \n\nvacatur. That remedy allows the agency’s original action or decision to remain in place while the \n\nagency corrects a deficiency in its NEPA compliance.\"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nIn support of that, in Lithium Nevada's August 11th filings\n\n[storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nvd.148512/gov.uscourts.nvd.148512.270.0\\_1.pdf](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nvd.148512/gov.uscourts.nvd.148512.270.0_1.pdf)\n\nthey specifically requested the following on page 25:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Any Remand Should Be Without Vacatur or Injunction.\n\n ENGOs make no attempt to save any injunctive relief request. ENGOs agree that vacatur is \n\n“not automatically applied” under the APA but argue remand without vacatur is “rare,” so the \n\nCourt should vacate the ROD. But the Ninth Circuit observed that “\\[r\\]emand without vacatur is \n\ncommon,” Nat’l Family Farm Coal. v. EPA, 966 F.3d 893, 930 (9th Cir. 2020), and the frequency \n\nis irrelevant: vacatur “depends on how serious the agency’s errors are and the disruptive \n\nconsequences of an interim change.” 350 Mont. v. Haaland, 29 F.4th 1158, 1177 (9th Cir. 2022). \n\nThe Court must consider the “environmental, economic, and energy-related consequences of \n\nvacatur.” Id. Remand without vacatur is appropriate in circumstances beyond undesirable \n\nenvironmental consequences. Pac. Rivers v. U.S., 942 F. Supp. 2d 1014, 1018 (E.D. Cal. 2013) \n\n(it is “not correct” to withhold vacatur “only in situations where environmental harm is likely to \n\nflow from” vacatur). The disruptive consequences and harms to Lithium Nevada, its employees, \n\nsurrounding communities, and the Nation would be severe, ECF 242 at 38-40. The alleged errors \n\nare minimal; BLM could substantiate its decision on remand. The economic and energy-related \n\nconcerns at stake are grave: current and future jobs, financial investment, and lithium our Nation \n\ndesperately needs.53 Id. The ROD should not be vacated because it would create “a disruptive,” \n\n“expensive” consequence harmful to the public. Pac. Rivers, 942 F. Supp. 2d at 1022. \"\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nLikewise, in the NEPA document and in the LAC's filings, there is discussion that shows an injunction is not mandatory as well in such a circumstance.\n\nWhile this does not guarantee that the Judge/Court will decide to vacate or not or place an injunction or not, it does allow for the opportunity (which I think would be a decent probability given the nature of the Plaintiffs claims) for the BLM to cure the deficiencies.\n\nIf vacated, than the BLM would restart the process (but likely the time frame would not be as long as previously done due to the work already done and the known issues).\n\nI hope that clarifies the issue,\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

These measurements capture not only light visible to our eyes, but also bands of light beyond the visible, into the infrared.\n\nAccording to the USGS and NASA, the data collected can be very **useful in studying surface rock formations because each mineral in rocks has its own unique reflection characteristics across the various bands of light**. Thus, looking for these patterns or ‘spectral signatures’ can help identify locations with high potential for mineral resources.\n\nThe research will also **include evaluating critical mineral potential in mine waste**.\n\n“Mine waste is receiving increasing attention for its potential to contain critical mineral resources, particularly those that are most often produced as byproducts, while also offering an opportunity for remediation of contaminated sites,” the agencies said in a media statement. “For instance, the USGS recently analyzed mine tailings from historical iron production in the Adirondacks of New York for rare earth element potential.”\n\nThe Geological Survey has also used hyperspectral data in the past to analyze mineral potential in Alaska but it has also found these data useful for understanding a variety of other earth science and biological issues including geologic acid mine drainage, debris flows, agriculture, wildfires and biodiversity.\n\n“This exciting scientific effort is made possible through President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law’s investments and will enable NASA and the USGS to leverage our unique capabilities toward a common goal,” USGS Director David Applegate said in the press brief. “The data we’re collecting will be foundational for not only critical minerals research but also for a wide range of other scientific applications, from natural hazards mitigation to ecosystem restoration.”\n\nThe **$16 million allocated to this project are part of a larger, $510.7-million investment provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for the USGS to support integrated mapping and interpretation of mineral resources data**, the preservation of data from geochemical samples from Earth MRI, and the construction of a USGS energy and minerals research center in Golden, Colorado.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe second press release from the USGS provides more detail and relevance to Thacker Pass:\n\n[www.usgs.gov/news/state-news-release/bipartisan-infrastructure-law-helps-map-critical-mineral-resources-nevada](https://www.usgs.gov/news/state-news-release/bipartisan-infrastructure-law-helps-map-critical-mineral-resources-nevada)\n\nBipartisan infrastructure law helps map critical mineral resources Nevada and Oregon\n\nResearch across the Silver State will provide data to improve knowledge of mineral resources vital to a range of Industries and the Nation's Economy\n\n By [**Communications and Publishing**](https://www.usgs.gov/communications-and-publishing) November 16, 2022 \n\n RESTON, Va. — The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in partnership with Nevada and Oregon officials, announces more than $1.45 million has been awarded to conduct geologic mapping, airborne geophysical surveying and geochemical sampling in support of critical mineral resource studies. \n\nThe **funding will support an airborne electromagnetic survey of more than 32,000 km2 (12,500 mi2) in northern and central Nevada and parts of southern Oregon**. In addition, **a grant to the Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology will support geologic mapping and geochemical analyses within McDermitt Caldera, which hosts some of the richest lithium deposits in the United States**. Collectively, these data will help improve our understanding of critical mineral resources within the region, a key step in securing a reliable and sustainable supply of the critical minerals that power everything from household appliances and electronics to clean-energy technologies like batteries, electric vehicles, and wind turbines.\n\nThe grants come from a $74 million investment allocated earlier this year to the [**USGS Mineral Resources Program’s Earth Mapping Resources Initiative**](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/earthmri) (Earth MRI), provided through annual appropriations and investments from the Biden-Harris Administration’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Overall, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is providing a $510.7 million investment to the USGS to advance scientific innovation and map critical minerals.\n\nThe USGS will conduct airborne electromagnetic and magnetic surveys over several key areas within the Great Basin that have known or potential critical-mineral resources, including lithium, beryllium, tungsten and a wealth of other commodities. The airborne survey will be the largest flown in the region, covering extensive portions of Nevada, the top mineral-producing state in the nation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Map of the survey Area of Interest in Nevada, Oregon and California. ](https://preview.redd.it/s7i37cplf73a1.png?width=1336&format=png&auto=webp&s=25f1dc4d1b50dcb415d82228ec62a57d99695c8e)\n\n \n\n“Combining airborne geophysics with geologic mapping makes for a powerful toolkit in resource mapping and assessment,” said **Paul Bedrosian, one of the USGS research scientists leading the geophysical surveys.** “These data provide a baseline for understanding the formation and distribution of mineral resources in the Great Basin, as well as improving our knowledge of groundwater, geothermal resources and seismic hazards.”\n\nThe **Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology will additionally carry out geologic mapping for critical mineral commodities, most notably lithium, within the McDermitt Caldera that spans the Nevada/Oregon border**. The geologic mapping efforts, which are managed through the [**USGS National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program**](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/national-cooperative-geologic-mapping-program)**,** will refine our understanding of the geology underlying areas of interest. In addition to helping identify mineral potential, these maps also support decisions about land use, provide information on water, energy and mineral resources and can help mitigate the impact of geologic hazards on communities.\n\n“This project provides an important investment in geologic mapping and geophysical surveys that will enhance our understanding of critical minerals in Nevada and the broader Great Basin region,” said **Jim Faulds, Nevada State Geologist and director of the NBMG.** “The geologic mapping defines the geologic conditions at the Earth’s surface while the geophysical surveys allow us to peer into the subsurface. The Earth MRI program is a great example of how federal and state agencies can work closely together to address important societal needs of the nation.”\n\nAirborne geophysical surveys flown as part of Earth MRI collect a combination of electromagnetic, magnetic, and radiometric data. Airborne electromagnetic surveys sense changes in the electrical conductivity of rocks which can be exploited to map stratigraphy, faults and alteration in three dimensions. This information allows scientists to identify locations of particular rocks that may be likely to host minerals of interest, as well as locate geothermal energy resources, groundwater resources, and potential earthquake hazards in the region.

    "selftext": "The following was a post by \"Roy K\" from a separate board:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nNow this post is definately directly related to LAC lol. The first article outlines Arena's latest acquisition of additional claims around the Pastos Grandes basin. \n\nMany of you are no doubt already very familiar with LAC's position in Arena, but I had to do some digging to help me understand, and some might find this useful. As always, where I'm wrong I'd love to be corrected so I might understand even more clearly. \n\nAs I understand it, both LAC and Ganfeng own 17% of Arena, as per Arena's Corporate Presentation, page 23. But their interest in Arena is quite different. Ganfeng owns 35% of Arena's Sal de la Puna Project, whereas LAC owns Arena common shares. In addition to common shares, LAC entered into a collaborative relationship with Arena in May 2022 to find ways to enhance the development of the whole Pastos Grandes basin. They established a Technical Committee composed of 6 members, three from LAC and three from SdlPH, or PASA (which is the required Agentinian incorporated entity that owns the Sal de la Puna Project, similar to how Minera Exar S.A. owns Cauchari). Presumably of PASA's three members, two would be from Arena and one from Ganfeng, in accordance with their interest percentages. \n\nThere is certainly a tangled web of development interests in this region of Argentina in which LAC, Ganfeng and Arena all play a part. Cauchari and the future expansion of Cauchari is relatively simple at this point when compared to what's going on in and around the Pastos Grandes basin where we have LAC's wholly owned Pastos Grandes project (formerly Millennial), and Arena's growing stake in the area. Any work done by the LAC/Arena Technical Committee would have applications not only for Arena's project(s), but also for LAC's Pastos Grandes project. In LAC's first investment announcement in Arena, in July 2021, mention was made of LAC perhaps increasing its ownership above 20% at some point, making one question if the future of Arena isn't perhaps a majority stake or perhaps outright acquisition by LAC and Ganfeng. \n\nAdd to this complexity the implications of the potential split of LAC's Thacker Pass and maybe all North American operations from Cauchari and probably all South American operations. Many contributors on various discussion forums have suggested that in order to totally divest from Ganfeng's fingerprints on anything related to Thacker Pass, LAC might need to trade some South American interest to get them out of their 11% ownership of common shares, which my math tells me is worth about USD $400 million. Ultimately might the organization and ownership of all of these Argentinian projects be impacted by LAC's split? \n\nFascinating\n\n[Arena Minerals to Acquire 2,000 Hectares Adjacent to R-01 Discovery in Pastos Grandes](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/arena-minerals-acquire-2-000-113000329.html)\n\n[LITHIUM AMERICAS ANNOUNCES INVESTMENT IN ARENA MINERALS INC.](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/news/lithium-americas-announces-investment-in-arena-minerals-inc)\n\n[LITHIUM AMERICAS INCREASES STRATEGIC INTEREST IN ARENA MINERALS](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/news/lithium-americas-increases-strategic-interest-in-arena-minerals)\n\n[LITHIUM AMERICAS ENTERS COLLABORATION AGREEMENT WITH ARENA MINERALS](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/news/lithium-americas-enters-collaboration-agreement-with-arena-minerals)\n\n[Arena Minerals Corporate Presentation](https://arenaminerals.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/AN-Corporate-Presentation.pdf)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nHope that helps,\n\nIRR,\n\n \n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

    "selftext": "[electrek.co/2022/11/07/new-electric-vehicles-would-qualify-for-tax-credit-with-new-bill/](https://electrek.co/2022/11/07/new-electric-vehicles-would-qualify-for-tax-credit-with-new-bill/)\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jkn2b2zszf0a1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=74295b75c7973a7f76126a49fbbff5852123d4aa\n\n# Almost all electric vehicles would qualify for the US EV tax credit with new Congress bill\n\n You may be in luck if you’re looking to buy an electric vehicle. A new bill introduced in the US Congress called the Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act would **allow essentially all EVs in the US to qualify for the $7,500** [**tax credit**](https://electrek.co/guides/ev-federal-tax-credit/) **if passed**. \n\n On Friday, a few members of the US Congress, including Terri Sewell (AL), Eric Swalwell (CA), Emmanuel Cleaver (MO), and Jimmy Gomez (CA), introduced the Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act, a new bill aimed **to lower the threshold of owning an EV**. \n\n The bill would establish a **phase-in period for the battery sourcing and manufacturing requirements included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in August**. \n\n [Hyundai](https://electrek.co/guides/hyundai/), in particular, has been one of several automakers that have publicly disagreed with the IRA bill’s provisions. The South Korean automaker [announced in May](https://electrek.co/2022/05/20/hyundai-motor-group-announces-its-first-dedicated-ev-facilities-coming-to-the-us/), before the IRA was passed, that it would be building a massive $5.5 billion electric vehicle plant in Georgia. \n\n Before the IRA bill, the Hyundai Motor Group’s EVs, such as the award-winning [IONIQ5](https://electrek.co/guides/hyundai-ioniq-5/), qualified, but that will no longer be the case once the new provisions kick in at the end of the year. \n\n Meanwhile, **foreign leaders** [**from South Korea, Japan**](https://electrek.co/2022/11/04/japan-south-korean-leaders-push-ev-tax-credit-rule-changes/)**, and the EU have lobbied for provision changes, expressing concerns over unfair competitive advantages.** \n\n Although Hyundai originally planned to begin construction in 2023, the South Korean automaker sped up its plans, [breaking ground on its plant](https://electrek.co/2022/10/14/hyundai-will-begin-construction-on-its-first-ev-to-retain-us-tax-credit/) in Bryan County, Georgia, on October 25. \n\n According to reports, Hyundai and other automakers are looking for a delay for the battery sourcing and manufacturing provisions kicking in at the end of the year to give them time to build and scale production. The Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act would do just that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pclxpmz10g0a1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=9944950112c2c21b771e11fe386552ec3dc826d3\n\n \n\n## A tax credit for all-electric vehicles in the US?\n\n The **Inflation Reduction Act is already doing its job as designed by bringing EV manufacturing jobs and investments back to the US. According to** [**a new report**](https://electrek.co/2022/11/04/japan-south-korean-leaders-push-ev-tax-credit-rule-changes/)**, climate initiatives have added at least $40 billion in planned battery investments and over 642,000 jobs since the start of 2021**. \n\n However, many of the planned facilities and other initiatives will take time to build and become operational. For example, Hyundai will start building EVs at its Georgia facility in 2025. However, with the IRA provisions setting in at the end of the year, Hyundai EV models will still be disqualified until then. \n\n The Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act aims to allow automakers like Hyundai to qualify until the plant is up and running, giving them time to scale production. \n\n Representative Cleaver explains: \n\n   \n**Our legislation takes important steps to make the historic electric vehicle tax credits passed in the Inflation Reduction Act immediately accessible to consumers, particularly working- and middle-class Americans who would like to purchase an electric vehicle but need the federal credit to do so. As oil companies insist on continuing their exorbitant price-gouging of American families at the pump, these tax credits offer hardworking Americans immediate and significant financial assistance to help them purchase a vehicle that is better both for the environment and their wallets.** \n\n The bill would delay when the EV battery sourcing and manufacturing requirements kick in to give car buyers access to electric vehicles while still promoting manufacturing in the US. \n\n \n\n## Electrek’s Take\n\n I like the idea of allowing foreign automakers, like Hyundai, to qualify for the tax credit, given that they already have plans set in stone to build electric vehicles in the US. The move would build upon the relationship with South Korea, a valued trade partner, while lowing the threshold for Americans to own an EV. \n\n At the same time, I don’t believe every EV should qualify. The **goal of the bill is to bring manufacturing back to the US**, hence why including Hyundai makes sense. \n\n There’s been [around $85 billion](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/14/fact-sheet-president-bidens-economic-plan-drives-americas-electric-vehicle-manufacturing-boom/) in electric vehicle, battery, and charging investments since 2021. Giving these initiatives time to develop while establishing a domestic supply chain in the US will help drive EV adoption in the long run, while solidifying relationships with critical trade partners. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n \n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

I met with Dr Dean, Vice President Research and Innovation at Lakehead University (Thunder Bay), we discussed collaboration and a future Critical Minerals strategy for Thunder Bay and GT1. I also had the opportunity to meet the Dean of Engineering, Technology & Trades, Colin Kelly and Dean of Workforce Development ,Carol Cline from Confederation College to discuss their role in supplying trades and Indigenous work force training as we ramp up at GT1. I was fortunate to also meet the Mines Minister, Hon George Pirie over breakfast to discuss the development of the GT1 lithium critical minerals supply chain in Thunder Bay and future work force planning for the region.\n\nGT1 attended a few conferences in Canada throughout the month which gave us the opportunity to meet with community leaders and local Thunder Bay businesses. We presented to Invest-Canada and associated NRCan, SIF and ISED, highlighting that we are an Allied Australian business operating in Ontario with the goal to **build a domestic critical minerals supply chain in Canada**. Further meetings are planned to **discuss downstream government funding and collaboration**. GT1 also presented at the Central Canada Expo (CENCAN) in Thunder Bay where the Mines Minister made a special trip to come and meet the GT1 team.\n\nWe now have approximately 80 people across our sites and all the right people leading our operations to deliver on becoming a pre-eminent integrated lithium business in Ontario, Canada. The team in Canada moved into larger and newer offices at NordMin due to rapid expansion of the team and to further develop of our corporate profile in Thunder Bay. The team are keeping me updated every day of their progress and what is happening on site so with 4 drill rigs now spinning 24/7 across both our Lithium Projects, stay turned for what is to come over the coming months as we continue to advance our high-grade lithium projects.\n\nOn a corporate front, GT1 has **executed a binding agreement to purchase the remaining 20% interest in our Ontario projects** and **extinguished the Royalty over the Root project**. To have secured 100% ownership of our key assets, and extinguished the Royalty over the Root Project, further cements our strategic industry positioning and removes the implicit economic burden of a free-carried minority interest over these assets. We completed a Bell Potter Investor Road Show where we had the majority of our major funds attend and new investors join the GT1 register.\n\nNovember marks our 1-year anniversary and looking back, it's amazing to see everything that has been achieved in just under 12 months. We will continue to hit these significant milestones and have **ongoing meetings with equity (offtake partners)** to further develop our pre-eminent vertically integrated lithium business in Ontario ,Canada. I am looking forward to the next month as we continue to expand our team and drive forward the development of our high-grade lithium projects.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pudpkv19i0y91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b35c9f466bdf8cd9a681601acef1b5397123e11d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **10 October 2022**[**GT1 BUY BACK      OF ROYALTY ON THE ROOT LITHIUM PROJECT**](https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02579916-6A1114526?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4)\n* **20 October 2022**[**INVESTOR PRESENTATION - SOUTH-WEST CONNECT CONFERENCE**](http://https/cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02584938-6A1116482?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4)\n* **24 October 2022**[GT1 EXTINGUISH ROYALTY ON THE      ROOT LITHIUM PROJECT](http://https/cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02586602-6A1117124?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4)\n* **24 October 2022**[100% OWNERSHIP OF ONTARIO LITHIUM PROJECTS](http://https/cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02586613-6A1117129?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4)\n* **28 October 2022**[THICK HIGH GRADE SPODUMENE FROM      SURFACE AT ROOT LITHIUM PROJECT](https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02589626-6A1118608?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4)\n* **31 October 2022**[QUARTERLY ACTIVITIES REPORT](https://cdn-api.markitdigital.com/apiman-gateway/ASX/asx-research/1.0/file/2924-02591805-6A1119649?access_token=83ff96335c2d45a094df02a206a39ff4)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nAdditionally, Luke Cox did a 12 minute video presentation discussing their status one week ago  at the South-West Connect ASX Showcase :\n\n[www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6989440006129901568/](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6989440006129901568/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cbx8pvg851y91.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&s=b748e7ee6af8b721b8c523b0c30b2ef704019c14\n\nAs a refresher, GT1 has a tremendous set of resources in its portfolio leading with its flagship resource Seymour (9.9Mt Lithium Resource):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/blryty8hk0y91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=90bbcafe80101b7572c609a3d3ef72d525887549\n\nLithium Americas involvement in GT1 includes its shareholder stake (5.2% ownership) and a collaboration agreement which has multiple key factors noted below (in particular, the information below helps to confirm what activities will be explored in collaboration with LAC - processing production to battery grade lithium) and potential funding with a focus on downstream conversion and aiding GT1 long-term to develop the supply chain across America:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4d0so7uxk0y91.png?width=872&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f031d6519706939c8aa9dee3d50d302cda64a42\n\nIf we use Seymour as a case example, it is likely LAC will be involved with Step C in the chart below:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ey45ynw6h1y91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=52ca84d7f9c2de0ab6cab94bc78b6e64203bf2b5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom another perspective, LAC is indicated to be involved in the downstream/processing/conversion activities noted below.:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e7tkwquti1y91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=42bca10162496d42a800844f81c8dac62b5ca30d\n\nDuring the course of the presentation, the CEO also mentioned that in his discussions with the government \\[specifically the Ministry of Mines and the Mine Minister\\] there were indications that GT1 may likely be able to tap into a significant amount of funding for the Lithium Hydroxide conversion plant as noted in the timeline below with first production of Spodumene expected in H2 2025 and first hydroxide production in H1 2027:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/61eptdq6i1y91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=95fbff8235257a1d89278d4be0b793b8f9a8ca60\n\nOverall, the momentum of GT1 is tremendous and LAC stands to not only benefit from its 5.2% share of ownership in GT1 but also from these deeper collaboration efforts in the Ontario resources which will open the doors to one of the largest resources in Canada and North America.\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to:\n\n1. \"Like\" this post\n2.

    "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nA recent article from September 6th, brings to light that the Biden Administration (via the DoJ) is in support of the Thacker Pass project (as evidenced by its own cour filings):\n\n[Race for US Lithium Hinges on Fight Over Mine in Nevada (bloomberglaw.com)](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/race-for-us-lithium-hinges-on-fight-over-mine-in-nevada)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSpecifcally, the court filing being referenced is the following:\n\n[Microsoft Word - NRS-#1342412-v1-ThackerPass\\_08112022\\_Reply\\_re\\_BR\\_MSJ\\_FINAL\\_as\\_filed.docx (aboutblaw.com)](https://aboutblaw.com/4H8)\n\nIn it, TODD KIM  Assistant Attorney General  United States Department of Justice  Environment and Natural Resources Div.  filed with the concluding remarks:\n\n\" For the reasons set forth above, BLM’s approval of the Thacker Pass project  complied with applicable law and was not arbitrary or capricious. Plaintiffs have not  carried their burden of demonstrating otherwise. The Court should therefore deny  Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and grant Federal Defendants’ motion.\"\n\nThe core of the case rests on whether the BLM took \"a hard look at the potential impacts of its decision and  provide for public notice and comment\".  The filing argues that the BLM did comply with the requirements and followed proper procedure as well as established protective and mitigation measures in some cases (e.g., with regards to sage grouse in an adjacent habitat).\n\nWe are nearing a decision very shortly and it appears that there may not be any oral arguments (as Judge Du has not noted any in response to the one request for Oral Arguments made by Lithium Americas in its filings).  I can only imagine she would only deny the request if she was filing in favor of Lithium Americas (otherwise she may open herself up to appeal).\n\nFurther more, Jonathan Evans is providing more confidence in his recent statements: \" On the back of the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) by U.S. Congress, we are having increased engagement with potential partners and customers focused on North America.”\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1440972/000117625622000261/exhibit99-1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1440972/000117625622000261/exhibit99-1.htm)\n\nEven more support from John Evans is mentioned in recent publications:\n\n\"As we prepare to commence construction at Thacker Pass, we see an opportunity to further strengthen our role in developing a North American lithium supply chain,\" Lithium Americas (LAC) President and CEO Jonathan Evans said.  “On the back of the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act (“**IRA**”) by U.S. Congress, we are having increased engagement with potential partners and customers focused on North America.”\n\n“In North America, Lithium Americas is focused on developing its 100%-owned Thacker Pass project (“Thacker Pass”) in Humboldt County, Nevada. The Company has received all federal and state permits necessary to begin construction and awaits a ruling on an appeal filed against the Bureau of Land Management on the issuance of the Record of Decision (“ROD”). The Company is actively preparing to commence construction, including planning early-works construction for late 2022, finalizing the selection of an engineering, procurement and construction management (“EPCM”) firm, hiring lead construction and project management roles, advancing financing and offtake discussions, and progressing the U.S. Department of Energy Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing loan program.”\n\n[https://twitter.com/lithiumamericas/status/1572195072640446466?s=46&t=TYpZ3667eFwVS5u\\_23puqQ](https://twitter.com/lithiumamericas/status/1572195072640446466?s=46&t=TYpZ3667eFwVS5u_23puqQ)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope that helps,\n\nGLTA\n\nIRR\n\n(If you like what you read, feel free to\n\n1.

    "selftext": "[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4545767-lithium-americas-partners-with-australian-group-to-create-lithium-tri-force](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4545767-lithium-americas-partners-with-australian-group-to-create-lithium-tri-force)\n\nThere are also a few interesting comments after the article that are worth reading as well in the link above. Below is the text from the article:\n\nDiscusses: \n\n* A hearing on motions concerning Thacker Pass is set for January.\n* News from the land down under, Lithium Americas pairs up with Green Technology Metals Limited (GT1).\n* Additionally, LAC has bought a small stake in GT1.\n* GT1 to develop the Canadian property and hand it off to Primero / Lithium Americas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n By Austin Craig for Seeking Alpha\n\n### Intro\n\nYears back I quit worrying about short-term price fluctuations be it daily or even monthly outcomes and so should you. Now I look at timeframes that involve years, if not a decade at times. I have been preaching on my lithium grandstand for years that the white metal is the future. Lithium is the new oil of this era.\n\nOnce you see the future, it is then only a matter of waiting for the masses to wake up and they are starting to emerge from the slumber as have lithium prices. In this article, we will focus on Lithium Americas (NYSE:[LAC](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LAC?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) and the relationship with Green Technology Metals (Ticker GT1 on the ASX). We will also glance at the motion concerning Thacker Pass.\n\n### A \"Miner\" Thacker Pass Lawsuit Update\n\nIn a past LAC article, my crystal ball foretold that a decision concerning Thacker Pass would not come till Q4 to Q1. I caught a lot of heckling from options traders with that prediction as they thought the decision would come before October.\n\n \n\nGranted, no one truly knows, but having been around the court system for a while, I thought the odds were high we would slip. Unfortunately, it appears I was correct in my assumptions of delays. Judge Du will hear \"pending motions\" on 1/5/2023. Do note the number to call in and listen below. Thankfully, they are muting listeners this time.\n\n>Date Filed#Docket Text10/06/2022273MINUTE ORDER IN CHAMBERS of the Honorable Chief Judge Miranda M. Du on 10/6/2022. By Deputy Clerk: Peggie Vannozzi.  \n>  \n>A hearing on pending motions is set for 1/5/2023 at 10:00 AM in Reno Courtroom 5 before Chief Judge Miranda M. Du.  \n>  \n>The hearing will be in person. Due to limited seating in the courtroom, members of the public may listen to the proceedings by calling the Court's AT&T line (1-888-251-2909, code 3803398 and pass code 010523.) All participants on the AT&T line, except for the host line, will be muted so that only the Courtroom can be heard by the participants.\n\n \n\nI do wonder what the schedule for the court case looks like after this hearing, and of course this may be followed by the Court of Appeals.\n\n### Lithium Americas And Green Technology Metals\n\nLithium Americas is by far one of the most aggressive lithium companies on planet Earth and now they are expanding by forming new partnerships. Not content to just have a massive near-completed lithium plant in Argentina, they purchased Millennial Lithium for $400 million (beating out CATL). LAC also invested in [Arena Minerals (](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lithium-americas-announces-investment-arena-130000140.html)[OTCQX:AMRZF](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMRZF?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)). Next, factor in the mind-numbing, large Thacker Pass project (and the rarely talked about associated areas around TP) and one would think that LAC would be content to develop what they have. Yet, this is not the case.\n\nWe now see Lithium Americas pairing up with Australian based [Green Technology Metals](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lithium-americas-announces-us-10-105900632.html). LAC has invested $10 million USD in the hard rock miner to acquire roughly 5% of the company. Per the PR from April, we see the intent is:\n\n>Key guiding principles of the Framework involve both parties working together in seeking to:  \nRapidly advance GT1’s Ontario Lithium Projects and fast-track the Seymour lithium project (80% GT1) into production.  \nDevelop midstream and downstream processing routes for battery-grade lithium chemicals in Ontario and across North America.  \nAdvance development plans and project financing for an integrated lithium chemicals business.  \nSource downstream offtake partners and deliver an integrated supply chain solution to customers.  \nLeverage Lithium Americas’ Lithium Technical Development Center in Reno to further test and develop intermediate and final lithium products.\"\n\nReading the highlights as above, we see the intent is to get the project going ASAP via project financing and creating a supply chain for battery-grade lithium chemicals.\n\n#### Strategic Collaboration\n\nOn the 20th of September, we see a [follow up agreement](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/09/20/2519118/0/en/Lithium-Americas-Enters-Strategic-Collaboration-Agreement-with-Green-Technology-Metals.html) between the companies:\n\n**HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n* Collaboration Agreement executed with GT1, a North American focused lithium exploration and development company with hard rock spodumene assets in north-west Ontario, Canada.\n* Builds upon Lithium Americas’ previous strategic equity investment in GT1 of US$10 million and established collaboration framework.\n* Provides non-exclusive rights to undertake collaborative activities between the two parties.  \nEstablishes a Strategic Management Committee for further joint exploration and development opportunities with focus on Canada and the U.S.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs we prepare to commence construction at Thacker Pass, we see an opportunity to further strengthen our role in developing a North American lithium supply chain,” said Jonathan Evans, Lithium Americas’ President & CEO. “On the back of the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) by U.S. Congress, we are having increased engagement with potential partners and customers focused on North America.\"\n\nLAC may try to help GT1 tap into the Inflation Reduction Act and quite possibly other funding sources via the Canadian and U.S. governments. They further state in the PR:\n\n>The Collaboration Agreement is intended to encourage increased communication and knowledge-sharing between Lithium Americas and GT1’s management and technical teams, with the following objectives:\n\n* Develop an integrated technical working group to consult on improving assets, metallurgical and process recoveries, and the refining of battery-grade chemical products;\n* Share resources and knowledge of early-stage lithium spodumene resources in North America, including consultations on findings, developments, new techniques and opportunities;\n* Leverage Lithium Americas’ Lithium Technical Development Center in Reno for testing and processing of hard rock lithium ore into intermediate and final lithium products;\n* Develop midstream and downstream processing strategies and routes for battery-grade lithium chemicals in Ontario and across North America;\n* Advance development plans and project financing for an integrated lithium chemicals business to deliver an integrated supply chain battery-grade chemical solution to customers; and\n* Engage offtake and downstream partners and customers.\n\n>  \n>  \n>The Collaboration Agreement includes the establishment of a Strategic Management Committee comprised of equal representatives from Lithium Americas and GT1, to **discuss strategic opportunities for joint exploration or development** and pursuit, establish a strategy development framework and facilitate and **oversee a joint development plan.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### LAC And The Lithium Tri-Force\n\nCue the \"Legend of Zelda\" music as we see LAC creating a lithium tri-force. The first part of this tri-force is LAC mining brine-based lithium in South America. Secondly, Nevada clay-based lithium and lastly, LAC is dipping its toes into rock-based Canadian lithium.\n\n \n\n### How We Are Playing It\n\nWith the clarity from the court case combined with a rather nasty stock market, we are taking a long-term approach to LAC. Mid-term elections might bring some stability, but then we have to contend with December tax loss selling. OPEC just cut oil production by a massive two million barrels, which may result in higher fuel prices and inflation concerns.\n\nFrankly, it will be a rough ride in the markets for some time. Hence, we will continue a mixed strategy of selling puts to acquire common stock and also selling covered calls against a fraction of the common we hold. The bulk of our common is held in reserve for long term.\n\nAt $23.11 a share, we view LAC as a good long-term value play given rising lithium prices and the large amount of tonnage LAC can mine from the South American project, Thacker Pass and the surrounding Nevada property. Factor in GT1 and Arena Minerals as wild cards and our assessment is LAC is a value play. Could it go lower? Absolutely in this market. Thus we will continue with our above strategy.\n\nHowever, it is wise to keep cash reserves in case things get worse from a macro perspective. However, to quote the movie \"The Crow\": \"It can't rain all the time.\" Eventually, we will get past these stormy waters. The U.S. will emerge from these times, as it often has; the markets will recover. When it does I want a strong basket of EV stocks to ride the euphoria.

    "title": "Text from Morningstar Report from 6/22/22 with $65 Fair Value Estimate",
    "selftext": "**Raising Our Lithium Producer Fair Value Estimates on Higher Price Forecast**\n\n**Analyst Note** Seth Goldstein, CFA, Senior Equity Analyst, 22 Jun 2022\n\nWe have raised our near- and medium-term lithium price forecast. Due to undersupplied market conditions, lithium prices are currently in the mid-$70,000 per metric ton range, which is near the all\u0002time highs set earlier this year and well above our marginal cost estimate of $12,000 per metric ton. While we expect prices to moderate slightly, we forecast lithium carbonate prices will average $70,000 per metric ton in 2023, down less than 10% from current levels.\n\nAfter updating our models to incorporate these changes, we raise our fair value estimates for the lithium producers we cover. Narrow-moat Albemarle's fair value estimate increases to $320 per share from $290. Narrow-moat Livent's fair value estimate increases to $38 per share from $35. Narrow-moat SQM's fair value estimate increases to $115 per share from $100. No-moat Lithium Americas' fair value estimate increases to $65 (CAD 84) per share from $49 (CAD 63).\n\nOur top pick is Lithium Americas, with the stock trading in 5-star territory at roughly one third of our updated fair value estimate. For investors who can withstand the additional company-specific risk, we view Lithium Americas' current price as an excellent opportunity to pick up shares of an emerging producer. The company's additional risk is largely the result of it not yet producing any lithium. As a result, the company carries additional risk that any of its three resources under development may underperform management expectations for timing, cost, or volumes. This underpins our very high\n\nuncertainty rating versus our high uncertainty ratings for existing producers Albemarle and SQM that have proven the ability to increase production. For investors who want to eschew increased company-specific risk, we also view Albemarle, Livent, and SQM as undervalued with the stocks all trading in 4-star territory based on our updated fair value estimates. Of the three, our top pick is Albemarle based on an attractive valuation and lower relative risk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Business Strategy & Outlook**\n\nLithium Americas aims to become a low-cost pure-play lithium producer. The company has no current lithium sales volumes but is developing three resources that should eventually enter production, with the first project to enter production by the end of 2022. Cauchari-Olaroz and Pastos Grandes are brine resources located in northwestern Argentina. Thacker Pass is the company’s clay resource in the U.S. state of Nevada.\n\nAs electric vehicle adoption increases, we expect maintained double-digit annual growth for lithium demand. Lithium Americas should benefit as there should be more than enough demand for company’s three resources to enter production and expand capacity over time.\n\nAt Cauchari-Olaroz, Lithium Americas owns 44.8% of the project, while Ganfeng, one of the world’s largest lithium producers, owns 46.7%. The remaining 8.5% stake is owned by JEMSE, an Argentina state-owned mining company. Once Cauchari-Olaroz enters production and begins ramping up volumes, the project should have a similar cost position as other Argentinean brines, such as the resources of narrow-moat Livent and Orocobre. The project plans to bring an initial 40,000 metric tons of capacity later this year, with plans for additional expansions.\n\nLAC owns 100% of the Pastos Grandes project. Located close to the Cauchari-Olaroz project in Argentina, Pastos Grandes is currently under development. The project aims to produce 24,000 metric tons per year.\n\nLAC also owns 100% of the Thacker Pass resource. The project faces legal opposition from environmental groups that could cause delays, however, we think the project will eventually enter production. Thacker Pass would be the first clay-based lithium resource to enter production globally. Currently, all lithium is produced from either brine (primarily in South America) or hard rock mining that produces spodumene (primarily in Australia) Thacker Pass plans on bringing on an initial 40,000 metric tons of capacity, with additional expansion plans\n\nLAC is considering separating the company into two businesses, based on geography. The argentina business would contain Cauchari-Olaroz and Pastos Grandes, while the U.S. business would contain Thacker Pass.\n\n**Bulls Say**\n\nThrough the ownership of three large lithium resources, Lithium Americas should be able to enter the lithium industry and become a major producer globally with one of the lowest-cost lithium carbonate resources and one of the largest rock-based resources globally.\n\nAs a lithium pure play, Lithium Americas is well positioned to increase profits from EV growth through lithium batteries.\n\nLithium prices will remain well above the marginal cost of production through at least the remainder of the decade, leading to excess profits and return on invested capital for Lithium Americas.\n\n**Bears Say**\n\nLithium Americas’ Thacker Pass operation will continue to face delays as activists fight to stop the project.\n\nLithium prices will fall as new supply comes online faster than demand, which will weigh on profitability. Lithium Americas' plans to develop three resources will prove value-destructive in the wake of lower prices.\n\nLithium Americas plans to produce lithium in Argentina, which exposes the company to the risk of increased taxes and royalties that will weigh on the company's profits.\n\n**Economic Moat**\n\nWe assign Lithium Americas a no-moat rating. The company currently does not have any projects in production and is not generating revenue. However, we view the company's three lithium production resources as a having the potential to generate excess returns on invested capital due to low cost of production.\n\nGlobally, lithium has been produced from either the evaporation of brine or the mining of spodumene minerals. Lithium Americas, along with partner Ganfeng, is currently in construction phase of its lithium brine project in Cauchari-Olaroz in Argentina's Jujuy province. With aims of production in the back-half of 2022, the Cauchari-Olaroz should have a similar cost position as other Argentinean brines, such as the resources of narrow-moat Livent and Orocobre.\n\nThe Cauchari-Olaroz project will pump brine from the underground aquifers above ground into reservoir\u0002like evaporation ponds to allow the brine to concentrate. With much of the water evaporated, the remaining salt can be processed into lithium derivatives, including lithium carbonate. In general, producing lithium carbonate from brines in Argentina costs less than when starting from spodumene or other brine resources with the exception of resources in Chile\n\nWhile the Cauchari-Olaroz project will have lower concentration levels and less desirable climate conditions than those of Chilean peers, Argentinean lithium brines sit in the bottom quartile of the global lithium cost curve. Despite a higher cash production cost than its Chilean peers, Argentina-based producers benefit from lower total royalties and taxes. The lower total royalties have diminished much of the gap between Argentina and Chile lithium costs.\n\nWhile we see the potential for the Cauchari-Olaroz project to become a low-cost resource, we currently assign it a no moat rating as the project is not yet in production. Development studies indicate the project could warrant a moat based on the cost advantage moat source. However, these estimates could prove significantly different from actual production costs. Should the project ramp up production with a bottom quartile unit cost, we would revisit our moat rating.\n\nPastos Grandes is currently in development, and we forecast the project will begin operations in the   late-2020s. The Pastos Grandes is located near Cauchari-Olaroz in Argentina and should have similar economics. We currently assign the project a no-moat rating, as the project is not in production, but plan to revisit once the company ramps up production.\n\nLithium Americas' Thacker Pass project in the U.S. state of Nevada, which we project will begin operations in the mid-2020s. Thacker Pass aims to produce lithium from a clay resource. Currently, all global lithium is produced from brine or spodumene resources and a clay-based resource project has never entered production. Based on the company's plan, the clay production process will be similar to spodumene mining, where clay will be dug out of the ground in an open-pit mine and processed into lithium carbonate\n\nThe lithium carbonate cost curve has traditionally been set by non-integrated producers who purchase and convert spodumene. Development studies indicate the potential for clay resources to be on the lower half of the cost curve. However, with no comparable resources, clay-based projects carry additional uncertainty as actual production costs could sit much higher on the cost curve. As a result, we see the threat of material value destruction should the project not be able to efficiently process clay into lithium chemicals, which precludes Lithium Americas from a narrow or wide moat rating.\n\nFurther, we see additional uncertainties around project timing, as Lithium Americas faces legal challenges to its permits from opposing activists. While we think Thacker Pass will ultimately be granted all required permits to begin construction, challenges could delay the project indefinitely. We view the potential of an indefinite delay as another threat of material value destruction that would prevent us from awarding Lithium Americas with a narrow or wide moat rating. As a result, we currently assign the Thacker Pass project with a no-moat rating. However, similar to views for the Cauchari-Olaroz and Pastos Grandes projects, we would revisit our moat rating should the project ramp up production with a low unit production cost.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Fair Value and Profit Drivers**\n\nOur fair value estimate is $65 per share. Our valuation will include all of Lithium Americas' assets until a spinoff of the U.S. business is formally announced\n\nOur valuation assumes roughly an 11% weighted average cost of capital and includes a 1% equity risk premium related to the company’s lithium operations in Argentina, which could be subject to increased royalties. We value free cash flows generated beyond our 10-year explicit forecast horizon at a multiple of 11 times midcycle EBITDA.\n\nWe assume Lithium Americas will bring all three of its resources into production starting with the Cauchari-Olaroz project in late 2022. By the end of the decade, we assume the company will produce a little over 150,000 metric tons per year on a LCE basis. We forecast Cauchari-Olaroz will ramp up to\n\n120,000 metric tons of capacity (including Ganfeng's share). We also assume the Thacker Pass project successfully resolves all court claims and moves forward. We forecast the project enters production by the middle of the decade eventually ramps up to 240,000 metric tons of capacity. We assume the Pastos Grandes project will ramp up to 24,000 metric tons of capacity, consistent with Millennial's plans before the acquisition.\n\nWe expect lithium carbonate prices (based on published indexes) will continue to rise in 2022, up from $16,400 per metric ton averaged in 2021. Spot prices as of mid-2022 were $73,500 per metric ton. As demand growth outpaces supply, we expect lithium prices will remain well above our long-term forecast for lithium carbonate at $12,000 per metric ton through the rest of the decade. Based on our price elasticity analysis, we forecast prices will average $70,000 in 2023. We expect high-quality lithium hydroxide used in long-range batteries will continue to sell at a premium to carbonate, reflecting higher conversion costs\n\nOur price forecast is based on our forecast for the marginal cost of lithium production on an all-in\u0002sustaining-cost basis. We expect lithium demand to grow at nearly a 20% annual rate from around 473,000 metric tons in 2021 to over 2.3 million metric tons by 2030. By 2030, over 90% of lithium demand will come from batteries that require high-quality lithium with few impurities. To meet demand, higher-cost supply will need to come on line from lower-quality resources that will require higher processing costs\n\n**Risk and Uncertainty**\n\nAs a pure-play lithium company with its first project set to begin production in 2022, project execution is the biggest risk facing Lithium Americas. This includes finishing construction on time and on budget, ramping up volumes, and becoming qualified to sell battery quality product.\n\nOnce its projects enter production, volatility in lithium prices will be another biggest risk facing Lithium Americas. Lithium prices could decline if electric vehicle demand grows more slowly than expected. Electric vehicle demand could undershoot expectations if fuel cell technology were to overtake lithium as the dominant power source for next-generation vehicles. Additionally, lithium production could ramp up more quickly than demand warrants if too much supply enters the market. Further, new lithium production technologies could alter the supply curve. Additionally, Lithium Americas is also planning to make large investments to increase its carbonate production capacity, which brings execution risk and could result in cost overruns.\n\nFinally, Lithium Americas will produce lithium in Argentina. This exposes the company to the risk that the government may impose additional taxes that would greatly reduce profits. Given the significantly lower total tax and royalty rate in Argentina versus Chile, we think all lithium producers in Argentina   face the risk of higher royalties, especially as President Alberto Fernandez campaigned on a populist platform.\n\nThe largest ESG risk comes from the potential that Lithium Americas’ Thacker Pass project does not receive permitting due to opposition from environmental groups. We see a moderate probability but a high materiality if this were to occur. Other risks come from potential emission reduction requirements. While we see this as having a moderate probability to occur, we see a low materiality as all lithium producers would be subject to the same requirements so the company could likely pass along these costs.\n\n**Capital Allocation**\n\nWe assign a Standard capital allocation to Lithium Americas based on our framework that assesses the balance sheet, investment decisions, and shareholder distributions.\n\nWe view Lithium Americas balance sheet as sound. The company currently has a clean balance sheet. Cash currently exceeds total debt on the balance sheet and should be enough to fund its portion of the remaining capital investments required for the Cauchari-Olaroz project to finish construction, enter production, and turn profitable. As a result, Lithium Americas should stay in a strong financial position.\n\nWe see management’s investment as fair. While none of its projects are in production, we believe Cauchari-Olaroz will likely fall on the low quartile of the global lithium cost curve and the investment will be value-accretive. The project will come online at a good time, as growing EV adoption will drive lithium demand in excess of supply growth for at least the next several years. Further, we are in favor of the plan to eventually expand capacity at Cauchari-Olaroz. We think these investments will create significant shareholder value over the long run as this should maximize the value from Lithium Americas’ resource in Argentina\n\nWe are also in favor of management’s development on the Thacker Pass project. While it would be first clay-based lithium resource globally, development studies indicate the project should operate well below marginal cost lithium producers. If the project successfully ramps up with costs near development study levels, we would be in favor of management’s plan to expand capacity at this site as well.\n\nAdditionally, we approve of Lithium Americas’ recent acquisition of the Pastos Grandes project in Argentina. We view the deal as value accretive to Lithium Americas. The project will likely have similar economics to Chauchari-Olaroz when it enters production in the late-2020s.\n\nFrom an execution standpoint, we rate the company neutral. So far, LAC has progressed on construction at Cauchari-Olaroz with its partner Ganfeng and has made progress in development work at Thacker Pass. However, our neutral rating is due to no project being in production yet. As management moves   forward on its plans, we will adjust our rating accordingly. We view Lithium Americas partnership with Ganfeng at the Cauchari-Olaroz project as positive. Ganfeng is a leading global lithium producer, with experience in both upstream and downstream operations. While both companies are new to Argentina, we believe the experience will help the project successfully enter and ramp up production at a low unit cost.\n\nFinally, we think distributions are appropriate. The company does not pay a dividend and has no plans to repurchase shares, which makes sense for a company investing heavily in growth. Even after Lithium Americas brings its first project into production, we would prefer the company continue to invest in capacity expansions. Accordingly, we would not expect the company to pay a dividend or begin to repurchase shares, as we expect it will remain in growth mode, spending cash flow on lithium capacity expansions. We think this is the best use of capital and would expect this to remain the case for at least most of this decade.\n\nCEO and President Jonathan Evans was previously the vice president and general manager for the lithium division at FMC (which is now Livent) until 2013.

    "selftext": "Hey Reddit, I need some e-bike battery expertise!\nBack in October, my UBCO e-bike was stolen. I managed to recover it, but unfortunately, the battery is now completely dead. I've tried charging it with the stock charger, but it's not responding at all.\nMy background is mostly with LiFePO4 batteries for my boat (12V systems). I know those often have a BMS that goes into a low-voltage 'sleep' mode, and I can usually revive them by jump-starting with another 12V battery.\n\nHowever, the UBCO uses what I believe is a 48V Lithium-Ion battery (please correct me if I'm wrong!). I'm wondering if it's safe to try and jump-start it using one of my friend's identical UBCO batteries, since they're also 48V.\n\nI'm aware these batteries have a BMS as well, and I'm concerned about potential safety issues. I did have the charging connections disconnected while troubleshooting voltage readings, but they are now reconnected.\n\nUBCO support has told me that if the battery is below 2.5v per cell that they do not recommend trying to jump it, due to cell instability.\n\nHas anyone had experience with reviving a deeply discharged UBCO or similar lithium-ion e-bike battery? Any advice on safe jump-starting procedures, or alternative recovery methods? The batteries are crazy expensive.\nThanks in advance!\n\n",

The idea is to keep all the chemical reactions inside the box and prevent chemicals from flying everything during explosion.\n\nDo you guys think this would ever help?\n\nWhat kind of metal would do the job, I guess copper or iron?",

    "selftext": "I had some time today and I decided to quickly look into if I should let my lithium ion batteries discharge more or keep them topped off. I've read a few sources with actual data (which my academic background loves). My issue is as follows:\n\nI've seen that a lower degree of discharge, for example 100%-70% rather than 100%-10% allows for many many more cycles before battery health goes down. \n\nThe problem here is that all graphs and data I found only compare cycles and degree of discharge without any normalization to output. Such as \"total usage time\" or some more meaningful measurement for the consumer. Meaning, if the above battery (100-70) gave me 3x the cycles of the 100-10 one, isn't that expected since I'm draining it 1/3 as much? And if it's a cell phone or game controller I'm both instances I'm getting 10k hours of use there is no difference.\n\nIs there any data out there that shows a less degree of discharge allows for more total energy output or usage? Something like \"Discharging to 25% compared to 75% resulted in a 34% increase in total device running time for the lifespan on the battery. Of note, a battery was considered no longer viable when it could only hold 40% of the original charge.\" Or whatever would be an appropriate metric for a battery lifespan. \n\nIf so, I'd be elated to have it linked here, or even explained.

    "title": "Bypass Charging",
    "selftext": "My knowledge on the topic is highly limited and there is a lot of conflicting information. Bypass charging seems to mean that the device \"knows\" when the battery is charged 100%. It then stops charging until it is down to e.g. 90 or 95% and then resumes charging. Rinse/repeat. This would of course mean that the battery is still drained in the long run, albeit much slower than if you would let it drain and recharge it without having connected to a charger (?)! This also means that there is a steady market for manufacturers to sell batteries or nowadays probably completely new devices. (Are there even still (Gaming) Laptops out there where you can buy new batteries for?) My interest here specifically is actually the bigger picture and the tech details. We all know that these days, most electronic devices lose their relevance after a couple of years anyway. But maybe it should matter more that cobalt mining is a difficult and problematic endeavour and we should start to try and keep battery use to a minimum if possible. So here's my big question: Is there a company that uses a system like \"Bypass charging\" in the sense that it actually physically disconnects the battery from the circuit in order to supply power directly to the device? If so - shouldn't Lithium Ion batteries be stored with a maximum of a 80% charge? Is it actually physically possible to disconnect a battery in a device like a cellphone or a Steam Deck or something similar? Are there safety issues? Is the whole thing just not viable from an economic standpoint?",

I've built a large battery pack, 3S6P, and I want to incorporate a charging system into the unit itself.\n\nI have found USB charging modules/PCBs that will take 5V 'dumb' USB and charge a 3S pack. These usually come in variants based on current. The most powerful draws 4 amps and after stepping up the voltage (5V to 12.6V), delivers 1.48 Amps.\n\nThe problem with that board is that no *dumb USB* source will provide 4 Amps, so I need to give it another 5V DC source.\n\nMy solution so far is to combine the following modules together like this...\n\n**ZY12PDN (PD trigger) -> 5V BEC (i.e. voltage regulator) -> 5V to 3S charging module.**\n\nI haven't tested it yet, but the PD trigger says it can handle up to 100W, the BEC can take between 7V and 25V (2S-6S) input and deliver 5V 6A DC. The charging module is going to be drawing far less than the rest can provide, so it should all be fine. Furthermore, I can set the PD trigger to demand a specific voltage, e.g. 9V or 12V, etc.\n\nMy problem with this is that it seems inefficient to be stepping down to 5V only to step back up to 3S.\n\nIs anyone aware of a better solution?",

This battery is non-removable meaning id have to destroy my glass in order to replace the battery(If they're even buyable?) so does anyone know if its even worth the bother?

I'm going camping and want to have the fan run as long as possible and I don't know how many times my power bank in going to be able to charge it. \n\nThe battery the fan comes with has written on it \"18650 3.7v 8.14Wh SZNS HI40513EM 810609\" like I said I don't really know much about these batteries so sorry if it is a dumb question, but I don't want to buy something that is going to be terrible or worse cause it to explode or something. I was doing a little research on types of 18650 batteries for certain things like flashlights and Vapes. But there is nothing on portable fans. I was wondering if I should go for a higher MAH and a low discharge rate or vis versa. Or do I want a battery that has a balance of both. My goal is to have the fan run as long as possible on what ever speed will get me there. Low/high doesn't matter I just want constant a airflow.\n\nAny insight on this will help thank you.",

    "selftext": "So I recently bought 2 electric scooters that need new batteries. I plan to franken them both together into one mega scooter, overvolted and over capacitied. The current (dead) batteries in them are two SunBright 12V4.5AH/20HR Lead Acid batteries, wired in series for a total of 24 volts. Batteries wired in series do not increase capacity.. so the total power is still 20HR right? anyway moving on i want to replace these batteries, but don't really want to buy lead acid because A They're heavy and B bad capacity. So i naturally think either LIPO or 18650, currently leaning for 18650 because they are easy to find and much safer, and cheaper. So i'm trying to figure out how many cells i would need and how to wire them to get the same capacity and voltage. here is my math:\n\nBatteries\n\nLead acid\n\n4.5AH = 4500 Mah (right?)\n\n12 volts\n\n54 Watt Hours (this is maybe wrong, as each battery has 20 HR written on it?)\n\n108 Watt Hours both (again maybe wrong)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLithium Ion\n\n2400 Mah\n\n3.7 volts\n\n8.88 Watt Hours (correct?)\n\n7 batteries for 24 volts\n\n8.88\\*6.08 = 54 watt hours\n\nso at 3.7 volts I got 8.8 watt hours per battery, so to get 54 watt hours (or 20 idk that's what the battery says) I would need\n\n6.13 batteries, so 7 batteries rounding up. To get 20 Watt Hours that's 20/8.8= 2.27 or 3 batteries rounding up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbut i also need 12 v, not 3.7, so would i have to wire a bunch in series to get 12v, then add them in parallel to get the required watt hours? any help would be appreciated, as I have no idea.

    "selftext": "**Why Argentina Is Emerging as the Most Promising Player in the Lithium Triangle**\n\nMuch has been said about the “Lithium Triangle” — the vast region shared by Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia, rich in salt flats and with enormous potential to lead the global energy transition. Yet within this triangle, Argentina is increasingly standing out as the most attractive destination for strategic investment.\n\nAs an Ambassador of the International Lithium Chamber, I’ve had the privilege of closely observing how the sector has evolved in each of these countries. And one thing becomes clear when you compare their paths: Argentina offers a uniquely advantageous combination of factors.\n\n🔹 **A decentralized but dynamic regulatory framework**: Unlike Bolivia, where the state maintains tight control, or Chile, where constitutional restrictions still apply to lithium extraction, Argentina allows its provinces a degree of autonomy that, when managed well, translates into faster project development and more flexible negotiations.\n\n🔹 **Openness to foreign capital and public-private partnerships**: Argentina has shown a strong willingness to attract international investment without imposing nationalization schemes or restrictions that limit operational control. This creates predictability and legal certainty for long-term projects.\n\n🔹 **Expanding geological potential**: Argentina’s salt flats are not only abundant, but many are still in the exploration phase — offering a prime opportunity for those looking to establish an early foothold in the global lithium market.\n\n🔹 **Rapidly growing human capital and know-how**: As projects advance, a professional ecosystem of skilled workers, technical experts, and local suppliers continues to grow, all with a long-term vision.\n\nWhat’s happening in Argentina’s lithium industry is not just growth — it’s evolution. There's a clear trend toward collaboration between public institutions, private stakeholders, and the scientific community. Of course, there are challenges ahead (logistics, macroeconomic stability, environmental sustainability), but there is also a real commitment to becoming a key player in the future of energy and mobility.\n\nFor those closely following strategic mining and the rise of electromobility, Argentina isn’t a gamble — it’s an informed decision.",

A carnivore’s dream, “The Rectangle” is famous for delicious, meaty dishes. Second, it’s beaches. Known for potentially having the finest beaches in the world, Portugal’s coastline is a sun tanner’s haven.\n\nThird, there’s Cristiano Ronaldo. The Juventus striker is considered by many to be the world’s best footballer. Although he hasn’t brought a World Cup home, he helped win the 2016 European Championship.\n\nNow, the first country in Europe to legalize all drugs is about to be known for something else.\n\n### Europe’s Largest Lithium Supplier\n\nLithium is an important resource. After all, the ‘world’s lightest metal’ powers electric vehicles and most consumer electronics. With plug-in cars becoming more popular across Europe, the region looks to buy more of the mineral powering these vehicles. Consequently, Portugal is set to benefit. After all, the country is the continent’s largest lithium supplier.\n\nFurthermore, the Portuguese government is fully aware of how lucrative lithium mining can be. Its secretary of state for energy plans to increase prospecting and mining projects throughout the country.\n\nThis is good news for both Portugal and the world. Moreover, a global lithium shortage has increased demand for the mineral as electric vehicles become more popular.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### The Competition\n\nHowever, Portugal is only the world’s 6th-largest lithium producer. Most of the world’s lithium comes from South America’s Lithium Triangle and Australia. Meanwhile, America’s only major lithium mine is near Tesla’s upcoming Gigafactory in Nevada.\n\nPortuguese lithium will help Europe become energy self-reliant. Currently, the EU relies heavily on Russian oil. Increasing its fleet of electric vehicles will drastically change this relationship.\n\nSoon, Europe’s most popular electric vehicle might run on European lithium. However, the Nissan Leaf‘s battery is more likely to feature lithium mined in Argentina.",

    "title": "Premier African Mineral's CEO George Roach expands lithium project by 22,000 hectares, potentially making it one of the biggest lithium deposits in the world",
    "selftext": "Premier African Mineral's CEO George Roach has recently confirmed on podcast last Friday that an EPO licence to expand its lithium project by 22,00 hectares has been granted. \n\nMost genuine shareholders believe that Zulu is huge and could be good. But just how good isn't easy to visualise. Zulu's Scoping Study or PEA if you prefer to call it that prepared by BARA Consulting helps. In that we’re given some reference pointers that are extremely useful. But although the PEA lays a marker in sand it gives very little guidance on scale and therefore potential which is what investors are keen to see and are understandably very interested in.\n\nWhat BARA have done is prepare a statement of fact on a fully SAMREC compliant but relatively very short length of just one of the known lithium strikes on the existing license area. That's all they're allowed to do and remitted to do. Consultants like BARA aren’t given to speculation. They have to be “mechanical” and deal with what they're asked to do. So BARA put together their excellent report and built a business model around what they considered. That's the extent of it!\n\nBut as I say BARA’s appraisal and models were based upon just 15% of one known strike which is just a small fraction of what's been identified so far on the current licensed area and Zulu’s potential. It follows therefore that BARA’s business models must be minimalist and read in that light. In just about every case mining reserves and resources increase over the LOM and mining plans change accordingly. That will apply nevermore so than in Zulu’s case.\n\nSo Prem took the PEA and from it estimated an overall resource and made their estimate known to shareholders saying it was for guidance only. But what  Prems estimate does is give an indication of scale much better than the PEA in that respect. It was based upon drill results and shouldn't be considered as simply as Prems guess. It’s much more accurate and scientific than that.\n\nIf anything Prems estimate is more likely to be conservative than not. Latterly in the drilling campaign Prem undertook further drilling to delineate newly discovered strikes that appeared to run on to the site boundaries and beyond. I believe those findings are just drillers notes so far and are neither disclosed of included in their estimate. To get a better idea of the affect of scale here's some benchmarking and calculations of my own. If I'm near right the results are simply breathtaking!\n\nIf the licensed area stays unaltered and we take Prems highest target resource we have a resource of 160mt's u/1.06% Li2O. Prem derived that from the known and measured strike used in the PEA and extrapolated it on a straightforward pro-rata basis. There were further strikes that were identified towards the end of the drilling campaign too but they weren’t counted in the estimate. The drilling was carried out purposely to delineate those strikes up to the boundaries and perhaps helped to justify Prems EPO application we see today..\n\nSo if we assume the 160mt's is about right. LCE prices are currently about $10.5k/t and the conversion factor to get from LCE to Li2O is x 2.473. So for ease of maths let's say the current Li2O price is $25k/t. That would give Zulu an “in-ground” value of 160m x 1.06% x $25k which is $42.4bn. It’s worth reiterating as I've used it later.  $42.4bn! \n\nThe largest hard rock lithium resource in the world is owned by AVZ Minerals in the DRC and it’s  resource there was increased to over 400mt's u/1.66% Li2O last December giving it an ”in ground” value of $166bn. Some 4x higher in value than Zulu’s in estimation.\n\nZulu is often benchmarked against Pilbara's mine in Australia too given it's of a similar size with similar grades. But Pilbara is three years or so ahead of Zulu and is in production now. It's resource is 216mt's @ 1.13% Li2O or something like that. So it's “in ground” value is $61bn just less than 50% higher in value than Zulu.\n\nAll very interesting. As is the fact that Zulu’s Lithium is very high quality. It  has a very low iron content which sets it’s  above most of it’s piers in the space. For that reason it’s sure to be highly sought after come the day.\n\nThese mines are massive and highly profitable by any measure. Pilbara's original mining plan was to produce over 300kt’s of battery grade Spodumene from a ROM of 2mt's/annum  giving the mine a LOM of over 20 years. But that's now been changed. Pilbara have doubled the ROM to 5mt's/annum and to catch the current market outlook I presume. It’s market cap from producing 300kt’s of Concentrate is $1.2bn albeit it’s All in Costs are likely to be higher than Zulu’s which bodes well and is very interesting too.\n\nNow here's the sting in the tail. Well for other miners at least. Prems EPO application increases Zulu's mining area from 350ha currently under license to over 22,000ha. That’s 57 x bigger!\n\nSo if you imagine the resource continues at the same density across the EPO area applied for that would give Zulu an “in ground” value of over $2.4 trillion. That’s fifteen times higher in value than the largest mine of it's kind in the world and forty times higher in value than Pilbara. All of a sudden Pilbara starts to take the size of a minnow such is the potential of Zulu! \n\nSome like to  value mines based on the value “in-ground“. It’s a quick and easy way and it’s a method adopted quite often.  We saw GR do it on HBR in the recent Webinar. He quoted  $22/ oz Au which is 1.5% or thereabouts of the projects resource. Most that use this say between 1% & 2% is appropriate.  So what GR did on HBR fits.\n\nI'm not a fan of this valuation method to be honest. There's better ways to value Zulu. Far better. However now I've mentioned the “in ground “ values it's just worth saying that using a factor of 1.5% Zulu's Market Cap on its current area would be almost $640m which suggests a SP contribution of 4p to 5p or thereabouts to Prem. But on its larger area Prems value would be many multiples of that. But whether it would be 57 times more on it’s larger EPO area is questionable in my mind. But a SP of £2.50 or thereabouts which equates to a 3,000 bagger  or $3m out of a £1k investment from here might be a slight exaggeration. Ha ha! \n\nApparently there's been two objections to Prems EPO application. One on economic grounds which I believe was rejected without much ado. The other was a \"blanket\" application that covered a much larger area that overlapped Prems. But it was made by someone that has no connections to Zimbabwe and never worked there..  A “try on” put simply and because of that it’s been said it too has little chance of full consideration.\n\nAs your probably aware in mining increasing the resource and/or extending the LOM has little impact on Market Caps and Share Prices in most cases. That's understandable given profitability usually remains largely unchanged. If the production level is unaltered it simply means the mine stays operational longer. So no big deal really especially when the LOM is reasonably long at its shortest. However I believe Zulu's situation couldn't be more different.\n\nAs I see it if the licence area remains unchanged we're unlikely to see Zulu plan to produce Lithium Carbonate from a chemical plant on site. Due to current site area constraints if Zulu  want to produce Lithium Carbonate we may have to opt for using the shared facility in Bulawayo that’s under construction at the moment and that defeats the object to a degree.\n\nOn the other hand if the licence area increases by a reasonable margin in the current EPO it could be cost effective for Zulu to build its own dedicated chemical plant adjacent to mining operations and ship the Lithium in Carbonate form.\n\nThe difference between the appraisals of the two options is huge particularly in financial terms. One would be good but the other could be exceptional.Truly exceptional if my understanding is anywhere near right.\n\nFor the purposes here I'm going to wear my positive hat and assume Prems EPO application  is successful at least in part and that the new enlarged area will be conducive to Carbonate production at the mine site. I'm also going to predict Lithium prices at the point of production a two years out in the case of Concentrate and four to five years out in the case of Carbonate. I’ve been conservative but based my views on increases in market demand and forecasts published by experts.\n\nSo please bear those two things in mind. As I say I’ve tried to be conservative in other areas but in my view they’re factors that shouldn't be ignored and left unconsidered\n\nBattery grade Spodumene is currently selling through offtakers at around $900/t & $1000/t. The current market price for Lithium Carbonate Equivalent on the other hand is around $10,500/t so perhaps through offtakers $7000/t some 7 x higher than >6% Spodumene Concentrate. That’s reflected in the BARA report too. So projected off takers prices then say $2k/t for  >6% Spodumene and $20k/t for LCE.\n\nIf I count the Petalite and Tantalum I'll ramble on forever and it's going to make the maths quite difficult to follow. So I've assumed they cancel each other out and ignored them. I think it's a reasonable assumption and conservative too..\n\nI've also used Zulu’s PEA and Prospects Arcadia Mine in Zimbabwe where I can for references to make my statements and calculations more factual and less “dreamy”. There are some key non-disclosures on their offtake agreements in Prospects presentations which is a shame but understandable for confidentiality.\n\nProspect haven't long entered into a seven year offtake agreement with Sinomine a Chinese offtaker on a build and transfer basis. Sinomine have agreed to design and build the mine but then transfer ownership of it to Prospect in a share swap arrangement of $10m for 10% stake and an offtake agreement for 70% of the Lithium Concentrate  produced for the next seven years. Prospect have a say in the mines design and take ownership of it when it's built. They pay for it’s cost then over a three year payback period I believe. It sounds a good arrangement but Sinomines payment rates under the agreement are undisclosed so I can’t be entirely sure.\n\nNow  here's an interesting part. Prospect have the right under the agreement to divert up to 50% of their Concentrate at any time to an owned Carbonate plant. That is step change for them given they've got the room on site. Their licensed area is 4x the current size of Zulu’s.\n\nArcadia’s  forecasting to start production within a year from a “spade in the ground” which is very quick especially considering the climatic conditions has been met. They intended to produce 200 kt's/annum of Lithium Petalite Concentrate and over 150kt’s of Spodumene Concentrate initially and whilst those targets may have been met they’ve just opened a chemical plant and are now  producing Carbonate too.\n\nThe Arcadia mine in Zimbabwe is said to be one of the largest hard rock Lithium mines in the world. At 0.2% cut off I think they have a resource of about 75mt's at similar grades to Prem. To put that into perspective Zulu has an assessed but well founded target of twice that and that's just on its current licensed area. Like all appraisals logistics must be considered. It will be the pinch point for Zulu in my view.  I doubt we will be able to ship much more than 300kt's/annum of by road to Bulawayo.\n\nSo with my positive hat on I like to imagine Zulu in 3 phases. Viz:-\n\nPHASE1 DFS - I think Zulu could command a  $100m to $150m Market Cap at this stage or more subject to reasonable fundamentals which I'm confident we'll see. If there are offers from suitors at this point Zulu’s value could be more. Substantially more and I see that as a real possibility.\n\nI've derived the basic value from Prospects deal with Sinomine where it was given a similar value in the same time & space. So if we have say Prem has10bn shares in issue then we get to a 1p share price contribution to Prem. Fairly straightforward.\n\nPHASE 2 in 2021 Zulu should be producing Lithium Concentrate. $80m Capex or thereabouts will be needed to build a Concentrate facility. So we should expect something like a 25% dilution to raise Capex finance.  \n\nZulu should  achieve a rate of 2m/t ROM/annum u/1.06% Li2O grade quite easily and similar to it’s industry piers. That would produce 300 kts >6% Spodumene at a quality better than battery grade. With a $1.5k/t offtake agreement that would give Zulu a $450m/annum revenue. C3 costs from the BARA report should be no more than  $550/t or $165m annualised . \"Earnings” therefore would be $285m giving Zulu's a notional Market Cap of $2.8bn using a P/E ratio of 10  and in turn a contribution to Prems Mare Cap of $2.1bn. Prem having retained 75% ownership. That’s very much in line with Pilbara’s appraisal.\n\nEven if Prem had say 12bn shares in issue by then  Zulu would contribute roughly 13p to it's SP at current exchange rates.\n\nPHASE 3 in 2024/2025 - Zulu could be one of the largest producing Lithium Carbonate mines from a hard rock source in the world. If not the largest. At least $500m Capex is going to be needed to build a chemical plant capable of producing 80kt's to 100kt's of Carbonate. I see most of that being funded out off WIP though with very little or no dilution or debt looking at the margins.\n\nProjected revenue from the sale of 80kt's Carbonate should be near $1.6bn/annum and projected AIC’s costs should be around $5k/t so perhaps $400m/annum. The cost figures have come from benchmarking against Zulu's piers.\n\nWith earnings then of $1.1bn the maths tells us we're looking at a Market Cap of $10bn and therefore a contribution to Prems SP of 75p or thereabouts. I said at the beginning of this the figures would be breathtaking and I think that one certainly is! Whilst Prems notional Market Cap wouldn’t be the highest in the Lithium space most but not all of the others are miners processing the metal from solution rather than hard rock.  \n\nIt's worth reiterating that the figures I’ve arrived at for the Concentrate alternative are projected two years out and those for the Carbonate alternative are projected five years out. We could well be looking at a huge mining operation in Zulu. Perhaps the largest of its kind in the world.\n\nThe ratios of value to cost have been derived from Zulu’s PEA  and there’s some rounding for ease of maths.\n\nIt's not too difficult to imagine Zulu and/or Prem coming under pressure from hostile takeover offers at or even before the point of DFS. Especially if the licenced area is increased. I've made Prem’s  management aware of my concerns and asked them to do whatever they can to protect us all as much as possible and to take steps  \nto mitigate this risk.\n\nAIMHO & GLA genuine shareholders.\n\nTedoby",

    "selftext": " \n\n### The Lithium Triangle: Clean Energy’s Trump Card\n\nMost people’s lives are affected by the lithium triangle. If you’ve ever used a cell phone or PC, chances are you’ve benefited from the region’s rich mineral wealth.\n\nMade up of South America’s 3 largest lithium producers: Argentina, Chile and Bolivia, the lithium triangle possesses 54% of the world’s lightest metal.\n\nEach country exploits this advantage in different ways.\n\n### Argentina\n\nMost sites throughout Argentina are at high altitudes. Large drills bore into the ground, allowing lithium to dissolve into evaporation pools. These pools also produce potassium and represent the most sustainable way to mine lithium.\n\nMeanwhile, Argentina’s depressed economy is working to take advantage of its natural mineral wealth. Consequently, the government has streamlined mining and exploration processes to attract business.\n\nOf the 3 lithium triangle members, industry experts point to Argentina as the best-positioned to benefit. Both working conditions and policies support this claim.\n\n### Bolivia\n\nAlmost a quarter of the world’s lithium can be found in Bolivia. Not surprisingly, it’s investing heavily in exploration and mining operations.\n\nHowever, production lags behind both Argentina and Chile. This has happened for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst, the left-leaning government scares off foreign buyers. The socialist state is not a free market darling, meaning an ideological clash hurts progress.\n\nSecond, brine mining is affected by weather. It relies on natural evaporation to dissolve lithium.\n\nLastly, it owns the lithium triangle’s worst working conditions. The poor country lacks the infrastructure enjoyed by its competitors.\n\n### Chile\n\nChile’s thirst for lithium has created a water war. Needed to pump lithium out of aquifers in the ground, companies are forced to compete for H2O.\n\nUnfortunately, this rings true for the world’s largest lithium mine. Called Salar de Atacama, the Chilean mine holds 33% of the world’s known lithium supply.\n\nThe salar runs 55km and forms the country’s lithium base.\n\nCurrently, Chile is the world’s largest supplier of lithium. However, Argentina is now a worthy challenger.\n\n### Paving the Future\n\nThe lithium triangle is the key to overcoming dirty energy. With Argentina leading the pack, these South American countries are positioning themselves to meet global lithium demand.\n\nFurthermore, the global lithium shortage is expected to increase the mineral’s value.\n\nAs China, North America and Europe electrify their transport industries, the lithium triangle will grow in global importance.",

    "selftext": "I am new to investing and looking to gain further insight on a specific topic I am interested in, which is deep sea mining for minerals. I’d love to hear your opinions on this controversial subject and explore the potential investment opportunities it may bring.\n\nDeep sea mining involves retrieving mineral resources from the ocean floor. With the demand for metals such as cobalt, lithium, and rare earth elements on the rise—key components in batteries, electronics, and renewable energy technologies—many companies are eyeing the vast mineral wealth buried beneath the waves.\n\nAt the heart of the deep sea mining discussion lies a debate about environmental impact versus economic necessity. Proponents believe that with responsible management and advanced technology, we can minimize environmental harm while reaping significant benefits. However, critics warn that the deep-sea environment is fragile and largely unexplored, meaning the long-term effects of mining activities are largely unknown. The potential for habitat destruction, the release of toxic materials, and the impact on species that are already threatened by climate change are all concerns that cannot be overlooked.\n\nThat all being said. Have you come across any investment opportunities—stocks or ETFs—focused on deep sea mining or the extraction of metals from the ocean? Currently, only a handful of companies and funds are involved in this sector, including those engaged in underwater exploration and resource extraction. However, it’s key to consider the associated risks. Investing in emerging technologies and industries often comes with volatility and uncertainty, especially in a landscape where regulatory scrutiny is tightening and opposition is mounting.\n\nWhere best might someone begin to invest in this market?",

I currently do artisan gold mining. I get the gold but its not big time gold because it really is manual gold mining and the proceeds are just enough to live on nothing big in paticular yet the ground itself is very loaded(I have done geological surveying and tests of the land). As for the lithium, I havent mined it yet especially because I dont know how to do so and dont know much about lithium but also have done tests and survyeing.   \nMy question is how do I get someone even a company overseas that is interested in mining lithium or gold at a massive scale to partner with me on my mines for mutual benefit. I feel I have been going about it in the wrong way. I am ready for site visits and whatever else that could assure them of a return on investment. \n\nThank you.  \n\n\nextra notes: I even own land(inherited from my Father) which is full of gemstones, green or brown tourmalines, I dont know which it is but the gems are dark under normal daylight but light up green when you shine light through them...That am not really interested in but also a possibility for investors who are interested.

We believe this is not an unusual event for a SPAC which has extended its time frame to close an acquisition. Seaport extended its time frame back in August and has undergone the expected redemptions associated with a SPAC. This reduced Seaport’s shareholder base and stockholders’ equity.”\n\nMr. Graber went on to comment, “Seaport has committed to address the NASDAQ letter and request time to satisfy all listing standards. It is belief that our joint efforts to consummate the merger transaction would satisfy NASDAQ listing standards upon completion of the merger. As such, we are committed to closing the merger for the benefit of our shareholders.”\n\n**Proposed Business Combination**  \nOn June 2, 2023, ABM and Seaport Global Acquisition II Corp.

    "selftext": " There is a method to electrify our automobiles, trucks, and buses without imposing the same hazardous burdens on specific populations that our existing energy system does. In truth, there is a clear place to begin: Reform the law in the United States that has allowed the mining industry to pollute freely for over a century and a half.   We understand that in order to preserve our planet from climate change and protect ourselves from volatile energy prices, we must rapidly build out electric vehicles, charging infrastructure, solar panels, and wind turbines to power our towns into a clean energy future.   \nThis transformation is known to be dependent on essential minerals such as lithium and cobalt, which are used in batteries that power electric vehicles and store sustainable energy.  With essential mineral demand predicted to increase by up to 500% by 2050 to power devices (such as laptops and cellphones) and clean energy technologies, we must ensure that demand is met in a secure and sustainable manner. We have an opportunity to achieve what the fossil fuel sector never did by committing from the beginning to preserve the communities and areas most touched by clean energy development. Mining produces critical minerals, which can often be reused once obtained. Mining operations, like the oil and gas sector, have damaged valuable environmental and spiritual sites while releasing toxic waste into our air, water, and land.    \n Updating our laws and regulations is part of the sustainable solutions needed to meet the demands for critical minerals and ensure that our clean energy future isn’t built on a foundation of dirty mining.  While we must endeavor to meet crucial mineral demand by reducing, reusing, and recycling current materials, we recognize that some mining will be required to get us to that clean energy future. That is why we are striving to modernize our mining rules and regulations in order to fulfill future demands while avoiding some of the most egregious impacts to people and the environment.  While we must endeavor to meet crucial mineral demand by reducing, reusing, and recycling current materials, we recognize that some mining will be required to get us to that clean energy future.   \nThat is why we are striving to modernize our mining rules and regulations in order to fulfill future demands while avoiding some of the most egregious impacts to people and the environment.  According to Earth Justice https://earthjustice.org/blog/2022-may/critical-minerals-mining-reform  For 150 years, the Mining Law of 1872 has governed mining operations on over 350 million acres of public lands—territory owned by the public but stewarded by the government for the benefit of the people.  The Mining Law of 1872, enacted during the gold rush era when the American government intended to \"settle\" the West and forcibly remove Indigenous people from their land, has remained practically unchanged since then.   Mining firms enjoy an even better deal under the law than other extractive industries like oil and gas, at the expense of US taxpayers, Indigenous communities, and environmental protections.   \n The existing law emphasizes mining over all other land uses, including iconic natural landscapes and Indigenous holy places, and permits mining companies to carry out dirty extraction operations without significant environmental safeguards or engagement with tribal populations. When these firms have depleted all available resources, current law fails to hold them accountable for cleaning up rampant pollution, leaving a legacy of toxic waste that harms communities for centuries.  Mining is harmful to the humans and the environment.  \n It could lead to massive loss of lives and properties.Blockchain projects like Nature’s Vault have advocated for abolishment of gold mining and Cardano has advocated for the reduction of carbon footprint. It is impossible to look past the issues raised by these projects. Mining is a serious issue and should not be taken lightly.",

    "title": "Premier African Mineral's RHA Tungsten Mine close to coming back to production",
    "selftext": "As an overview RHA is located approximately 20 km south-east of Hwange and 270 km north of Bulawayo in the prospective multi-commodity Kamativi Tin Belt in north-west Zimbabwe. It sits in its own licence area of 1800ha or 4400 acres which is roughly  five times bigger than Zulu under its  current license area and slightly bigger than the Scilly Isles for perspective.\n\nPicture the scene of a disused and long abandoned  mine in the middle of the Zimbabwean countryside as it was when Prem first saw it in  2012. The site was overgrown and the old shaft there must have been like an old well full of foul smelling run off rainwater . The shaft was accessible via two adits one North and one South which were relatively small but clearly visible. They still exist and are in use today I believe.  \n\n\nCrossing the mining area was a low ridge approximately 850 m long and 300 m wide standing about 120 m above its surroundings. \n\nThere was known to be mineralised ore body that included wolframite and copper in a strike approximately 400 m long and 150 m wide. Grades of the WO3 were found to improve in a south easterly direction towards the existing shaft and at depth. Seven Lodes were identified and they were previously exploited early in part  in the mines 100 year history. \n\nThe old mine workings were in the form of an underground mine with two adits, open pits, caved stopes, trenches, roads and rock dumps that occupied the surface. Tailings and  dumps were located on the north and south sides of the ridge and complete the picture.  \n\n\nRHA comprised  50 mineral claim in the 1800 Ha, consisting of 10 owned by Prem and 40 under option.\n\nSmall-scale surface and underground mining was conducted at the site between 1931 and 1979, with total production from the mine is  standing at 1 247,65 tonnes of WO3 in concentrate containing 65 percent APT.\n\nIntermittent small scale mining was  carried out at both RHA and the adjacent much smaller Tung mine (which Prem had an option over at the time) between 1931 and 1979.  The mines jointly produced 1,247 tonnes of wolframite concentrate at an average concentrate grade of 65% WO3. So perhaps 80,000mtu was produced at RHA which today would have a sale price of just $210m.\n\nThe mine workings were almost entirely carried out during the 1930s where the underground  mine which was accessed via the two adits in the sides of the ridge and a single vertical shaft down to the 845m level. \n\nSome open pitting was also carried out mainly in the western part of the strike.  \nDuring the mid to late 1970s Falconbridge Ltd, trading as Blanket Mines in Zimbabwe, carried out underground geological mapping and extensive channel sampling on the accessible parts of the underground workings, principally on the 926, 895 and 859 levels. \n\nTheir exploration work had to be curtailed . But undoubtedly this mapping together with any previous data would have formed an integral part of Prems due diligence and would have helped in the preparation of RHA’s first Scoping Study which was to be completed later in 2013. \n\nPrem joined the AIM market mid December in 2012 and by that time it had purchased RHA in a  j.v. with the Governments Fund NIEEF by necessity.  \n\n\nThe j.v. had been formed under a Letter of Intent at the time and Prem through its subsidiary owned 49% of the mine in keeping with the indigenisation law that was in place. \n\nEarly in 2013 saw further drill results announced as RHA was working towards a SAMREC code compliant resource and it’s PEA or Scoping Study as it’s also known.  \nIn August that year Prem announced RHA’s PEA that confirmed its SAMREC compliant resource.This was the first milestone for the mine un it’s j.v.’s ownership. \n\nThe study was minimalist and simply based on an extension of  Lode 2 out of the 7 Lodes identified at the mine. Lode 2 then became known as Lodes 2A for the original length & 2B for it’s extension. \n\nNevertheless the Assessment confirmed the economic potential of Lode 2 in isolation demonstrated it would support a tungsten mining operation with an annual  Run of Mine rate of 192kt’s from an open pit and underground mining strategy over a six year LOM from just $13.5m Capex.  \n\n\nOther projected fundamentals such as an NPV of $118m an  IRR of over 300% and Free Cash Flows in excess of $20m/annum  were equally encouraging at the time.  \n\n\nTungsten  prices were then almost twice what they are now at around $400/mtu APT and that figure was the one used in the study. All very acceptable if not attractive.  \n\n\nMost significantly really good news ensued shortly after Prem joined the market. It came from discovering a significant new Lode extension in late in 2013.  \n\n\nFurther drilling was carried out on what was then identified as Lode 2A until December that year. Some extremely high grades were identified as well as many new WO3 veins in the Lodes. The results were then RNS’d on 13th March 2014.  \n\n\nThese drilling results were stella and they rocked the market to its vore as no doubt some long term shareholders invested at the time will recall. \n\nThe grades were consistently higher than had been previously identified. But the highest was a world record testing  35% WO3. More than 350kg/t.  Simply incredible and jaw dropping. Hitherto the j.v. partners were looking at grades of 0.8% or 8kg/t as exceptional. \n\nThe new Lodes  were categorised as Lodes 1E.1W.1FW & 1FE and were announced in a further RNS on May 1 2014. The discoveries were to increase the resource by a further 1.3mt’s at an average grade of over 1% or 10kg's/t. A huge increase and the overall effect on RHA was transformational. \n\nThis is what the press had to say:-  \n“The measured and indicated resource has been upped by a staggering 957% to 1.55mln tonnes at a composite grade of 8.0 kg/t WO3, while there is 1.2mln tonnes at a composite grade of 9.7kg/t WO3 in the inferred category.”\n\n[http://zimbabweinvestor.com/premier-african-minerals-soars-on-massive-zimbabwe-resource-upgrade-agrees-ethiopia-bridging-loan/](http://zimbabweinvestor.com/premier-african-minerals-soars-on-massive-zimbabwe-resource-upgrade-agrees-ethiopia-bridging-loan/)  \n\n\nThe period that followed up to the time when RHA was put on care & maintenance in January 2018 would see a myriad of further changes to the resource and mining plan. The changes wern’t all brought about just by the ongoing route in APT prices and the difficulty of raising debt finance especially but those two factors clearly had quite an influence.  \n\n\nMostly they came about from RHA gaining a much better understanding of the mineralisation on the site through further exploration and drilling campaigns. An understanding that has been costly and time consuming to say the least.  \n\n\nI could go on and on but let's fast forward to where are now. Now we have a much better understanding of the resource and in particular where the higher grades of WO3 are located in the underground mine.  \n\n\nAlthough the existing pit is covered by a layer of  blown in silt and debris we know from drill results that the strike runs generally in an East/ West direction and the WO3 grade improves on strike towards the existing shaft and at the same time at depth as new blocks have been identified.  \n\n\nWe also know that that is a small amount of WO3 located in the old tailings and that that is readily accessible and easy to deliver to the ROM pad to compliment the rest of the WO3.  \n\n\nAlthough Prem haven't disclosed a new mining plan yet it seems the mine will be restarted more or less where it left off with the added bonus that it’ll be electrified from the grid.  \n\n\nHopefully with higher grades being accessible from the newly cut stopes the mine will be profitable shortly after it restarts.  \n\n\nAs with any mine RHA needs to be optimised and then run in a steady state.  \n\n\nWhen the mine restarts mining will be restricted to  underground via the old shafts and adits. The anticipated fundamentals include a ROM of 6kt's/month at a grade of around 0.7% at least hopefully.  \n\n\nTo completely  optimise the mine  it needs further investment the new semi automated incline shaft built. Once built that will not only allow the mining rate to be increased to more than double but also allow unfettered access to mine the pit.  \n\n\nWhen that's done in say a years time.the ROM should be around 40kts /month and subject to APT prices we should see a contribution to Prems MC from it of perhaps £60m even at suppressed APT prices. \n\nIf APT prices were to be around the $400/mtu APT forecast by many industry experts it will be an extremely attractive asset for Prem. Perhaps as much as 1p on Prems SP as things stand.  \n\n\nSo FWIW I think we'll see Commercial Production reached within a month or so of the mine restarting and at that point RHA's impairment [removed.at](http://removed.at/) that point I have Prems fair value of the asset at $20m which represents 0.15p on its SP.  \n\n\nIn cash terms Prem should begin to receive an income under its newly negotiated Rental Agreement and its new Management Contact incorporated in the head Shareholder Agreement on RHA.  \n\nFrom the old agreement I have those combined to be over $750k/annum. But I'm not entirely sure. Payments to Prem under its Loan Agreement needs to be considered too but as yet the details are undisclosed..  \n\n\nI hope some of this is of interest. But more than that I hope \"RHA has its day in the sun\" as GR tells us.  \n\n\nAIMHO and fingers crossed.   \n \n\nTedoby",

    "selftext": "How relevant will mining and the mining industry be in the future? For example, petroleum and gas are quickly being replaced by alternative energy, could something similar happen to the mining industry? One other example I can think of are diamonds. Diamonds are made of carbon, so humans have found a way of creating synthetic diamonds from the very same carbon atoms that are somewhat common. I'm not saying synthetic diamonds are going to replace mined diamonds but we have found a viable alternative. Of course the mining industry is more diverse than just carbon based natural resources, materials like Iron/steel, copper, rare earth minerals and uranium are the corner stone of modern society, could the mining of (some of) these resources also be replaced by synthetic materials? Other carbon based materials like carbon nanotubes and graphene give traditional structural and conductive materials a run for their money on structural strength and electrical and thermal conductivity. As of now most of these materials are not available in commercial quantities. Are there any synthetic materials being studied in material science that has potential to replace gold, rare earth minerals, uranium or silicon for high-tech applications such as energy production, computation or photonics? Would mining still be needed to acquire all the carbon or any other material?",

    "selftext": "Hi,\n\nCurrent geology student here, finishing up my final year and hoping to move into the mineral exploration industry soon. My interests lie mainly in REE's and other elementary metals like Wolfram and Lithium, this is mainly because I don't want to get stuck in a single field (ie Gold, Oil or Coal) and prefer to branch out over a number of smaller specialities.\n\nOver the last 4 years we have read countless studies and watched many video's on the mineral industry in central Africa. Many of these really caught my attention, most of the mining was being done by people with shovels digging at the surface with no real clue what they were doing, merely digging there because someone else just happened to come across it earlier.\n\nMy thinking is if the area could be studied properly, not only could they better target the ore body and potentially start larger pit or underground mining and thus generate more profit, but if they were of significant economic value they might be picked up by a larger 'reputable' company that might have the potential to force rebels out and attempt to smooth out inequality in the area. Hence it would likely benefit the locals (when comparing it to the current scenario). I'm guessing there might be some cowboy geologists out there that may be doing this already, like small groups out looking for fame and fortune kinda thing as I assume this could be very good money if you found a big deposit.\n\nProblems are that these regions tend to be somewhat dangerous with tough working conditions and authorities that like to be bribed and don't cooperate otherwise. Though, I like adventure and challenging work, seems like a good fit.\nMy guess is they wont hire somebody with minimal experience off the bat and that these jobs are somewhat rare and limited to senior geologists (as why risk westerners when you can get a local to do it for you, and if your going to risk a westerner why risk a guy with little experience).\n\nI am just wondering what kind of short term goals I should be looking to achieve to move into this specific area? Anyone know any particular organisations/groups/people that might be able to give some general advice for moving into this part of the industry?\n\nOr does anyone know of any cowboy geologists/companies doing this already I can have a chat to?",

    "title": "King Copper’s Ghost: The Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Natural Resource Curse",
    "selftext": " The Democratic Republic of the Congo is currently in the midst of an Ebola outbreak that has cost the lives of 191 individuals. Although a vaccine for Ebola has finally been developed, constant warfare makes it all but impossible to distribute treatment. The recent history of the DRC has been marked by brutal series of wars that has cost of over 4 million lives, and the DRC has a per capita income under $800. This dismal picture is shocking given that Congo is blessed by rich deposits of copper, diamonds, cobalt and other national resources. Today’s podcast episode is going to focus on why Congo has been unable to translate this natural resource wealth into prosperity for ordinary people. In part one, I will discuss the paternalistic policies of the Belgian Congo and how the left the country unprepared for independence. In part two, I will discuss the corruption of the Mobutu regime, and how the mining industry collapsed under his rule. Finally, in part three I will discuss the current transformation of Congo’s mining industry, and the pivotal role the Congo will play in the rise of electric cars.\n\nMany of my readers are likely familiar with the ruthless rule of King Leopold in the Congo Free State that cost the lives as many as 8 million Africans. If not, I strongly recommend reading [King Leopold’s Ghost](https://www.amazon.com/King-Leopolds-Ghost-Heroism-Colonial/dp/0618001905), by Adam Hochschild. The Belgian government took over the administration of 1908, and very much took “the White Man’s Burden” seriously. By 1960, the Belgian Congo had eradicated the tsetse fly from populated areas, and the highest literacy rate in sub-Saharan Africa. However, there was a very real dark side to Belgian rule in the Congo. Exploitation and coercion where everywhere. The government forced Congolese to work one sixth of the year on public works projects, and private corporations had the power to force Africans to work on plantations.\n\nThe achievements of the Belgian Congo were financed by the rich reserves of copper in the Katanga province of Congo, and UMHK, an Ango-Belgian conglomerate, sent the bulk of its profits to Europe. The Belgian colonial government deliberately privileged certain ethnic minorities to create ethnic conflict they could manipulate. Above all, the Belgian government saw Africans as little more than big children and presumed they would rule indefinitely. The education made primary education readily available, but only a handful of university graduates. At independence there wasn’t a single African military officer in the police and security forces, and no Africans in the colonial administration with real authority. The Belgians left the Congolese as unprepared as possible for independence.\n\nAfter independence, the United States supported the regime of Mobutu Sese Seko, a brutal and corrupt dictator because he was strongly anti-Communist.  At first, the mines ran much as before, with mining output reaching all time highs of around 500,000 tons in the late 1970s. However, the government assumed the period of high commodity prices would last forever, and so did not maintain large financial buffers, or invest in maintenance. Instead, the Congolese elite consumed the wealth with avarice. The fall of the USSR proved a disaster for Mobutu mean the end of vital American support. The power lines that connected the mines in the interior to hydro-electric power plants on the coast were cut by militias, and rioters chased the ethnic minority that held the majority of management jobs in the mines. Mining output decreased from close 500,000 tons of copper to 35,000 in 1993. In 1994, millions of Rwandans refugees fled into the Congo in the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide, sparking the brutal Congo Wars and putting the final nail in the coffin in the Congolese mining industry.\n\nThe DRC’s mining industry has steadily rebuilt itself after the end of the Second Congolese war in 2003. Cobalt has emerged as a key component in the manufacture of lithium ion batteries used in electrical cars. Soaring demand has led to the price of cobalt more than doubling over the last two years to $50,000. While some electric car companies, such as Tesla, are attempting to minimize the use of cobalt, demand is likely to soar in coming years. Whether the Congo benefits from this boom is a more complicated question. About one fifth of the cobalt is comes from artisanal mines, where wages are low and workers as young as seven.  Dan Gertler, an Israeli businessman who financed the father of the current dictator’s rise to power, controls the allocation of new mining permits. The Inga-Kolwezi transmission lines that connect hydro-power dams at the mouth of the Congo to Katanga only generate power for the mines, but not the surviving villages. While export revenues have soared, it is unclear if Congo has the institutions to transform this into prosperity for ordinary people.\n\nThe DRC’s natural resource wealth has not benefited ordinary people because those in charge have little incentive to do so. The Belgians had no incentive to make to Congolese capable of self rule. Mobutu had little incentive to allow the countries resource wealth to benefit those not connected to his regime. The current regime does not seem able to use Congo’s resource wealth in a way that benefits the country. The news stories coming out of Congo are almost universally tragic, whether it is civil war or epidemic. Changing the narrative about the Congo will require reforming the countries institutions. Lets hope this time the Congo manages to do so.\n\n# Selected Sources\n\n[Copper Giants Lessons from State-Owned Mining Companies in the DRC and Zambia](https://resourcegovernance.org/sites/default/files/documents/nrgi_nmc_english.pdf)\n\n[MORE CONTINUITY THAN CHANGE?
